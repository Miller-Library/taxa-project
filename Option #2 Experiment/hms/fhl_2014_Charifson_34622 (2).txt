Abstract: 
 
The relationship between propus size and use of snails as prey in sympatric populations 
of Hemigrapsus nudus and Hemigrapsus oregonensis was investigated. Propal height and propal 
width increases with body size in a predictable manner in male and female crabs of both species. 
Sexual dimorphism of propal height and width relationships in both shore crabs is apparent, but 
there was no detectible difference in chela size between H. nudus and H. oregonensis. The lack 
of difference in chela size between sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis suggests that there is 
no character displacement in this trait. Both species of crabs showed a strong feeding preference 
for the thin-shelled gastropod Lacuna vincta over the thicker shelled Littorina scutulata, likely 
due to the ease of consumption. There were no differences in snail consumption rates between 
male and female H. nudus of similar propal heights, mostly due to high feeding variation among 
individual crabs.  
 
Introduction: 
 
A multitude of species coexist in the marine intertidal environment. Closely related 
species may be sympatric and compete for resources, such as food. Two species of shore crab, 
Hemigrapsus nudus (Dana 1851) and Hemigrapsus oregonensis (Dana 1851), occur in sympatry 
in the Salish Sea. Both species are sexually dimorphic, with the males having larger chelae. 
Species in sympatry may exhibit character displacement, the exaggeration of morphological or 
behavioral characteristics due to competition for resources (Brown and Wilson 1956). When H. 
nudus and H. oregonensis co-occur, H. oregonensis tends to be found closer to the waterand in 
finer sediment than the more desiccation-tolerant H. nudus (Sliger 1982). There is still 
considerable habitat overlap between these two species; the underside of a single rock may have 
Charifson 3 
 
roughly equal abundances of the two crab species (personal observation). The size of the chela 
may differ, which could allow the crabs to differentiate in food resource utilization. 
Both species are omnivores that eat algae and small invertebrates, including snails 
(Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). The two shore crab species are known to eat Littorina 
sitkana (Philippi 1846) and Littorina scutulata (Gould 1849), which also occur in the rocky 
intertidal zone (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Li. scutulata moves upshore in response 
to the presence of H. nudus and crushed conspecifics, where H. nudus density is lower (Keppel 
and Scrosati 2004). This suggests that H. nudus represents an ecologically significant predation 
threat to littorines.  
 
The thick shelled littorines are difficult prey for both H. nudus and H. oregonensis as 
neither crab species is a molluscivore specialists; they typically scrape or pick algae and softer 
invertebrates off rocks using their chelae (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Behrens 
Yamada and Boulding (1998) found that large H. nudus were capable of consuming Li. sitkana 
that were less than 8 mm in length, but had only a 37% success rate of consuming snails with 
lengths between 5.5-7 mm .  
I sought to investigate differences in propus size between between males and females of 
these two crab species. The size of the propus of the chela is positively correlated with the 
amount of force that can be produced due to greater musculature (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 
1998). A significant difference in propus size between the two species would suggest that further 
testing of character displacement may be warranted. A disparity in propus size to body size 
between male and female crabs might result in different feeding rates and shell breaking 
capabilities. I devised a test of preference by varying snail shell strength within the same size 
class. The snail species Li. scutulata and Lacuna vincta (Montagu 1803) are both in the family 
Charifson 4 
 
Littorinidae and have similar shell shape but different shell thickness. Lacuna vincta has a 
thinner, more fragile shell and is likely to be preferred as prey by shore crabs. I also hypothesize 
that, if chela size is held constant, female crabs will have greater snail consumption rates than 
male crabs. Female crabs with claws equivalent to males have a larger body mass,are likely to 
have greater metabolic need, and are less easily satiated. 
 
Study System: 
 
All specimens were collected on San Juan Island, Washington.  Two shore crabs (clade: 
Brachyura: Family Grapsidae), Hemigrapsus oregonensis  and Hemigrapsus nudus were 
collected in the intertidal adjacent to the Friday Harbor Laboratories dock. These closely related 
crabs are morphologically similar, but can be distinguished by the presence of purple spots on 
the cheliped of H. nudus and abundant setae on the pereopods of H. oregonensis (Kozloff 1987). 
Lacuna vincta, in the Class Gastropoda and Family Littoridae, were collected at False Bay and 
Dead Man Cove. Littorina scutulata, in the Class Gastropoda and Family Littoridae, were 
collected from the rocky intertidal zone of Fourth of July Beach.  
 
Materials and Methods: 
Morphometrics 
 
Male and females of H. oregonensis and H. nudus were measured with digital calipers 
(0.1 mm). Each crab was measured for carapace width, propal height and propal width. Carapace 
width was taken at the widest part of the carapace. Propal height was measured at the highest 
vertical distance along the propus. Propal width was measured perpendicular to propal height, 
from the left to right sides of the propus. All claw measurements were made on the left cheliped. 
Charifson 5 
 
If there was a size disparity between the left and right claws due to regeneration of a lost claw, 
the crab was excluded from the study. Ratios of carapace width:propal height (CW:PH) and 
carapace width:propal width (CW:PW) were calculated.  
 
Crab Feeding Preference 
 
Three female (Fe1, Fe2, Fe3) and three male (Ma1, Ma2, Ma3) crabs of H. nudus with 
propal heights between 5-6 mm were placed in small flow-through containers. Five L. scutulata 
and five L. vincta with shell lengths between 4-6 mm were added to each container. The ranges 
of crab propal height and snail shell length were chosen based on prior studies to ensure that the 
crabs were capable of feeding on the hard-shelled L. scutulata (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 
1998). H. oregonensis was excluded due to the rarity of female crabs of that species within the 
range of appropriate propal heights. After approximately 15 hours the number of L. scutulata and 
L. vincta consumed was counted. Three trials were conducted for each crab. 
Snail Consumption by Hemigrapsus nudus 
 
The crabs from the preference experiment were given five of each snail in each trial. 
After 1.5 to 3 hours the number of snails consumed was counted and converted to a consumption 
rate (snails consumed/hour). A total of eight feeding trials were conducted.  
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
For the morphometric analysis, crabs were divided into four groups based on sex and 
species. Standardized major axis regression was used to determine the relationship between crab 
morphometric parameters. Arcsin transformations were used to correct for non-normality (Sokol 
and Rohlf 2011). Differences in CW:PH and CW:PW were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA 
Charifson 6 
 
with factors: Sex and Species. Prey selection by H. nudus was analyzed using G-tests for each 
individual that consumed snails. An one-way ANOVA was used to determine differences in snail 
consumption rates by H. nudus.  
 
Results: 
Morphometrics: 
 
Carapace width was a good predictor of both propal height (Figure 1, Table 1A) and 
propal width (Figure 2, Table 1B) in female and male H. oregonensis and H. nudus. There was 
less variation in the relationship between carapace width and propal height than with propal 
width.  Due to non-normality of CW:PH and CW:PW an arcsin transformation was used. A 
significant effect for sex was found for both CW:PH (F1, 45 = 125.6, p < 0.001) and CW:PW  (F1, 
45 = 103.81, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between Hemigrapsus species for 
CW:PH (F1, 45 < 0.01, p = 0.983) and CW:PW (F1, 45 = 0.09, p = 0.764). A significant 
sex*species interaction was detected for both CW:PH (F1, 45 4.39, p = 0.042) and CW:PW (F1, 45 
= 7.19, p = 0.010). Figure 3 and 4 show the means of CW:PH and CW:PW in by sex and species 
respectively.  
 
Crab Feeding Preference:  
 
Expected values for both the number of L. scutulata and L. vincta consumed for the G-
test are 0.5 multiplied by the total number of snails consumed by each individual crab. G-tests 
for individual H. nudus that eat snails were all significant at p < 0.001 with 1 degree of freedom 
(See Table 2 for statistical summary). The three crabs that did not eat either L. scutulata or L. 
vincta could not be tested for feeding preference.  
Charifson 7 
 
 
Snail Consumption by Hemigrapsus nudus 
 
No significant difference in crab feeding rate (snails consumed/hour) was found (F2, 21 = 
2.52, p = 0.104) among individual H. nudus that fed on snails during the course of the 
consumption experiment (Figure 5). Fe2  ate snails at a rate of 0.59Â±0.53 snails/hour (variance is 
standard deviation), Ma1 feeding rate was 0.24Â±0.31 snails/hour, and Ma2 had a feeding rate of 
0.80Â±0.38 snails/hour. Individuals Fe1, Fe3 and Ma3 did not consume any snails during the 
course of the experiment.  
 
Discussion: 
 
A few interesting patterns emerged in the morphometric analysis of Hemigrapsus nudus 
and Hemigrapsus orogenensis. The variance in propal height or propal width explained by 
carapace width was surprisingly high in female H. nudus with R2 values of 0.976 found for 
propal height and 0.927 for propal width. Male H. oregenensis had the greatest variation in chela 
size parameters, demonstrated by R2 of 0.693 and 0.534 for propal height and propal width 
respectively. The R2 values for propal width regressed against carapace width were consistently 
lower than propal height regressed against carapace width across species and sexes (Table 1). In 
general the ability of carapace width to explain the variance in chela size parameters (i.e.: R2 
values) was greater in females of both crab species (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2). Males may have 
more variation in claw size due to trade-offs between claw size and factors like feeding 
efficiency or resource allocation. Trade-offs relating to chela size are found in fiddler crabs, 
which exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. Fiddler crabs have a trade-off between the intrasexual 
competition and intersexual signaling functions of the dimorphic claw (Swanson et al. 2013). 
Charifson 8 
 
This is not to say that the particular trade-offs in fiddler crabs case are analogous to that of 
Hemigrapsus, since both claws in the two shore crabs in this study are used in feeding.  
Sexual dimorphism in chela size, which is readily apparent to the eye in both 
Hemigrapsus nudus and Hemigrapsus oregonensis, was detected statistically (Figures 3 and 4). 
The two-way ANOVA with factors sex and species did not show a significant species effect, 
suggesting that the claws of both shore crabs produce roughly the same force and are 
functionally equivalent (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1998). The lack of morphological 
difference in the size of the chelae between the crab species removes the possibility of character 
displacement in the trait. It should be noted that this study was not designed to test for character 
displacement, but to determine if this would be an interesting question for future investigations. 
To make a compelling case for character displacement it is necessary to compare multiple 
sympatric and allopatric populations with similar abiotic and biotic conditions (Stuart and Losos 
2013). Also it must be demonstrated that the trait differs due to genetic differences between 
sympatric and allopatric populations, that the differences between the populations are not due to 
species sorting, that the morphological trait is correlated to differences in resource use between 
the two sympatric species, and that the similar phenotype in allopatric populations compete for 
the same resources (Stuart and Losos 2013). The tendency of H. nudus to occupy the upper 
intertidal zone (Sliger 1987), despite considerable overlap with H. oregonensis, may provide 
enough differential resource use to prevent exclusion in sympatry. Desiccation tolerance may be 
a better trait to test for character displacement in these shore crabs.  
H. nudus males and females clearly preferred to eat the thinner shelled Lacuna vincta 
(Table 2). During the course of the feeding preference experiment all the crabs that ate snails 
consumed L. vincta exclusively. However, one Littorina scutuala was eaten by H. nudus when 
Charifson 9 
 
determining consumption rates. The six crabs were chosen because their claws were of 
appropriate size to eat littorines with shell length between 4-6 mm, yet only half of the crabs ate 
these snails. This could be due to insufficient time to acclimate H. nudus to lab conditions and 
possibly reduced feeding associated with molting. Male snow crabs, Chionoecetes opilio, were 
shown to cease feeding 3-6 weeks before and 3-4 weeks after molting (OâHalloran and OâDor 
1988).  
It was my original intention to test for sex differences in consumption rates, but this was 
not possible as I could not collect many crabs of the appropriate claw size for gastropod feeding 
and many of the crabs I did collect did not feed. There were no statistically significant 
differences in consumption rates (snails eaten/hour) among the three feeding H. nudus. These 
individuals had highly variable feeding rates, mostly due to trials in which the crab did not feed. 
Sylvia Behrens Yamada and Elizabeth Boulding (1998) found that H. nudus consumed 1.8 
Littorina. sitkana/individual crab/day. In my study crabs fed on 13.03 Lacuna vincta/individual 
crab/ day. The greater consumption rate in my study is likely due to the easily breakable shells of 
La. vincta.  
The findings of this study suggest that there is no potential for character displacement of 
chela size in the sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis. This leaves the question of species co-
occurrence open to other possibilities. H. nudus has a strong preference for La. vincta, but it 
seems as if there have been no studies that show predation on La. vincta in the field. It should be 
noted that H. nudus and La. vincta usually occupy different portions of the intertidal and may 
have little contact with each other, unlike the relationship between H. nudus and Li. scutulata. 
There is some potential for overlap in the winter when La. vincta migrates up shore. Although no 
differences in consumption rates between male and female H. nudus were found, this might be 
Charifson 10 
 
due to logistical issues surrounding the experimental design and little replication. Future studies 
should include more crabs, the exclusion of non-feeding crabs, and trial periods with longer time 
intervals. Additionally, any subsequent study should utilize multivariate and geometric 
morphometric methods to quantify claw shape instead of using ratios, as two similar ratios may 
have different shape.
