## Motivation for Checker

We wanted to compare the outputs between our private model and Print 0.3 (public) model on Transkribus. Our private model
was trained using 70 pages of student papers with the Print 0.3 as our base model. Consequently, our private model perform significantly worse than the Print 0.3M model.

Upon further research and guidance from Transkribus's support team, our results was an example of overfitting.
Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model learns the details and noise in the training data to such an extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. In essence, an overfitted model performs very well on training data but poorly on validation or test data.

As a result, the print 0.3 was deemed effective enough with an character error rate (CER) of 1.6%. CER measures the number of characters that were incorrectly predicted compared to the ground truth, normalized by the total number of characters in the ground truth.

Below is the gallery of text comparisons:
