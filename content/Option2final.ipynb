      "Introduction: \n",
      " \n",
      "A multitude of species coexist in the marine intertidal environment. Closely related \n",
      "species may be sympatric and compete for resources, such as food. Two species of shore crab, \n",
      "Hemigrapsus nudus (Dana 1851) and Hemigrapsus oregonensis (Dana 1851), occur in sympatry \n",
      "in the Salish Sea. Both species are sexually dimorphic, with the males having larger chelae. \n",
      "Species in sympatry may exhibit character displacement, the exaggeration of morphological or \n",
      "behavioral characteristics due to competition for resources (Brown and Wilson 1956). When H. \n",
      "nudus and H. oregonensis co-occur, H. oregonensis tends to be found closer to the waterand in \n",
      "finer sediment than the more desiccation-tolerant H. nudus (Sliger 1982). There is still \n",
      "considerable habitat overlap between these two species; the underside of a single rock may have \n",
      "Charifson 3 \n",
      " \n",
      "roughly equal abundances of the two crab species (personal observation). The size of the chela \n",
      "may differ, which could allow the crabs to differentiate in food resource utilization. \n",
      "Both species are omnivores that eat algae and small invertebrates, including snails \n",
      "(Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). The two shore crab species are known to eat Littorina \n",
      "sitkana (Philippi 1846) and Littorina scutulata (Gould 1849), which also occur in the rocky \n",
      "intertidal zone (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Li. scutulata moves upshore in response \n",
      "to the presence of H. nudus and crushed conspecifics, where H. nudus density is lower (Keppel \n",
      "and Scrosati 2004). This suggests that H. nudus represents an ecologically significant predation \n",
      "threat to littorines.  \n",
      " \n",
      "The thick shelled littorines are difficult prey for both H. nudus and H. oregonensis as \n",
      "neither crab species is a molluscivore specialists; they typically scrape or pick algae and softer \n",
      "invertebrates off rocks using their chelae (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Behrens \n",
      "Yamada and Boulding (1998) found that large H. nudus were capable of consuming Li. sitkana \n",
      "that were less than 8 mm in length, but had only a 37% success rate of consuming snails with \n",
      "lengths between 5.5-7 mm .  \n",
      "I sought to investigate differences in propus size between between males and females of \n",
      "these two crab species. The size of the propus of the chela is positively correlated with the \n",
      "amount of force that can be produced due to greater musculature (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \n",
      "1998). A significant difference in propus size between the two species would suggest that further \n",
      "testing of character displacement may be warranted. A disparity in propus size to body size \n",
      "between male and female crabs might result in different feeding rates and shell breaking \n",
      "capabilities. I devised a test of preference by varying snail shell strength within the same size \n",
