      "Introduction: \n",
      " \n",
      "A multitude of species coexist in the marine intertidal environment. Closely related \n",
      "species may be sympatric and compete for resources, such as food. Two species of shore crab, \n",
      "Hemigrapsus nudus (Dana 1851) and Hemigrapsus oregonensis (Dana 1851), occur in sympatry \n",
      "in the Salish Sea. Both species are sexually dimorphic, with the males having larger chelae. \n",
      "Species in sympatry may exhibit character displacement, the exaggeration of morphological or \n",
      "behavioral characteristics due to competition for resources (Brown and Wilson 1956). When H. \n",
      "nudus and H. oregonensis co-occur, H. oregonensis tends to be found closer to the waterand in \n",
      "finer sediment than the more desiccation-tolerant H. nudus (Sliger 1982). There is still \n",
      "considerable habitat overlap between these two species; the underside of a single rock may have \n",
      "Charifson 3 \n",
      " \n",
      "roughly equal abundances of the two crab species (personal observation). The size of the chela \n",
      "may differ, which could allow the crabs to differentiate in food resource utilization. \n",
      "Both species are omnivores that eat algae and small invertebrates, including snails \n",
      "(Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). The two shore crab species are known to eat Littorina \n",
      "sitkana (Philippi 1846) and Littorina scutulata (Gould 1849), which also occur in the rocky \n",
      "intertidal zone (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Li. scutulata moves upshore in response \n",
      "to the presence of H. nudus and crushed conspecifics, where H. nudus density is lower (Keppel \n",
      "and Scrosati 2004). This suggests that H. nudus represents an ecologically significant predation \n",
      "threat to littorines.  \n",
      " \n",
      "The thick shelled littorines are difficult prey for both H. nudus and H. oregonensis as \n",
      "neither crab species is a molluscivore specialists; they typically scrape or pick algae and softer \n",
      "invertebrates off rocks using their chelae (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Behrens \n",
      "Yamada and Boulding (1998) found that large H. nudus were capable of consuming Li. sitkana \n",
      "that were less than 8 mm in length, but had only a 37% success rate of consuming snails with \n",
      "lengths between 5.5-7 mm .  \n",
      "I sought to investigate differences in propus size between between males and females of \n",
      "these two crab species. The size of the propus of the chela is positively correlated with the \n",
      "amount of force that can be produced due to greater musculature (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \n",
      "1998). A significant difference in propus size between the two species would suggest that further \n",
      "testing of character displacement may be warranted. A disparity in propus size to body size \n",
      "between male and female crabs might result in different feeding rates and shell breaking \n",
      "capabilities. I devised a test of preference by varying snail shell strength within the same size \n",

      "Littorinidae and have similar shell shape but different shell thickness. Lacuna vincta has a \n",

      "that, if chela size is held constant, female crabs will have greater snail consumption rates than \n",

      "size parameters, demonstrated by R2 of 0.693 and 0.534 for propal height and propal width \n",
      "respectively. The R2 values for propal width regressed against carapace width were consistently \n",
      "lower than propal height regressed against carapace width across species and sexes (Table 1). In \n",
      "general the ability of carapace width to explain the variance in chela size parameters (i.e.: R2 \n",
      "values) was greater in females of both crab species (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2). Males may have \n",
      "more variation in claw size due to trade-offs between claw size and factors like feeding \n",
      "efficiency or resource allocation. Trade-offs relating to chela size are found in fiddler crabs, \n",
      "which exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. Fiddler crabs have a trade-off between the intrasexual \n",

      "Charifson 8 \n",
      " \n",
      "This is not to say that the particular trade-offs in fiddler crabs case are analogous to that of \n",

      "Sexual dimorphism in chela size, which is readily apparent to the eye in both \n",
      "Hemigrapsus nudus and Hemigrapsus oregonensis, was detected statistically (Figures 3 and 4). \n",
      "The two-way ANOVA with factors sex and species did not show a significant species effect, \n",
      "suggesting that the claws of both shore crabs produce roughly the same force and are \n",
      "functionally equivalent (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1998). The lack of morphological \n",
      "difference in the size of the chelae between the crab species removes the possibility of character \n",
      "displacement in the trait. It should be noted that this study was not designed to test for character \n",
      "displacement, but to determine if this would be an interesting question for future investigations. \n",
      "To make a compelling case for character displacement it is necessary to compare multiple \n",
      "sympatric and allopatric populations with similar abiotic and biotic conditions (Stuart and Losos \n",
      "2013). Also it must be demonstrated that the trait differs due to genetic differences between \n",
      "sympatric and allopatric populations, that the differences between the populations are not due to \n",
      "species sorting, that the morphological trait is correlated to differences in resource use between \n",
      "the two sympatric species, and that the similar phenotype in allopatric populations compete for \n",
      "the same resources (Stuart and Losos 2013). The tendency of H. nudus to occupy the upper \n",

Propal height and propal \\nwidth increases with body size in a predictable manner in male and female crabs of both species. \\nSexual dimorphism of propal height and width relationships in both shore crabs is apparent, but \\nthere was no detectible difference in chela size between H. nudus and H. oregonensis. The lack \\nof difference in chela size between sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis suggests that there is \\nno character displacement in this trait. Both species of crabs showed a strong feeding preference \\nfor the thin-shelled gastropod Lacuna vincta over the thicker shelled Littorina scutulata, likely \\ndue to the ease of consumption. There were no differences in snail consumption rates between \\nmale and female H. nudus of similar propal heights, mostly due to high feeding variation among \\nindividual crabs.  \\n \\nIntroduction: \\n \\nA multitude of species coexist in the marine intertidal environment. Closely related \\nspecies may be sympatric and compete for resources, such as food. Two species of shore crab, \\nHemigrapsus nudus (Dana 1851) and Hemigrapsus oregonensis (Dana 1851), occur in sympatry \\nin the Salish Sea. Both species are sexually dimorphic, with the males having larger chelae. \\nSpecies in sympatry may exhibit character displacement, the exaggeration of morphological or \\nbehavioral characteristics due to competition for resources (Brown and Wilson 1956).

The two shore crab species are known to eat Littorina \\nsitkana (Philippi 1846) and Littorina scutulata (Gould 1849), which also occur in the rocky \\nintertidal zone (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Li. scutulata moves upshore in response \\nto the presence of H. nudus and crushed conspecifics, where H. nudus density is lower (Keppel \\nand Scrosati 2004). This suggests that H. nudus represents an ecologically significant predation \\nthreat to littorines.  \\n \\nThe thick shelled littorines are difficult prey for both H. nudus and H. oregonensis as \\nneither crab species is a molluscivore specialists; they typically scrape or pick algae and softer \\ninvertebrates off rocks using their chelae (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1996). Behrens \\nYamada and Boulding (1998) found that large H. nudus were capable of consuming Li. sitkana \\nthat were less than 8 mm in length, but had only a 37% success rate of consuming snails with \\nlengths between 5.5-7 mm .  \\nI sought to investigate differences in propus size between between males and females of \\nthese two crab species. The size of the propus of the chela is positively correlated with the \\namount of force that can be produced due to greater musculature (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \\n1998). A significant difference in propus size between the two species would suggest that further \\ntesting of character displacement may be warranted. A disparity in propus size to body size \\nbetween male and female crabs might result in different feeding rates and shell breaking \\ncapabilities. I devised a test of preference by varying snail shell strength within the same size \\nclass. The snail species Li. scutulata and Lacuna vincta (Montagu 1803) are both in the family \\nCharifson 4 \\n \\nLittorinidae and have similar shell shape but different shell thickness. Lacuna vincta has a \\nthinner, more fragile shell and is likely to be preferred as prey by shore crabs. I also hypothesize \\nthat, if chela size is held constant, female crabs will have greater snail consumption rates than \\nmale crabs. Female crabs with claws equivalent to males have a larger body mass,are likely to \\nhave greater metabolic need, and are less easily satiated. \\n \\nStudy System: \\n \\nAll specimens were collected on San Juan Island, Washington.

The ranges \\nof crab propal height and snail shell length were chosen based on prior studies to ensure that the \\ncrabs were capable of feeding on the hard-shelled L. scutulata (Behrens Yamada and Boulding \\n1998). H. oregonensis was excluded due to the rarity of female crabs of that species within the \\nrange of appropriate propal heights. After approximately 15 hours the number of L. scutulata and \\nL. vincta consumed was counted. Three trials were conducted for each crab. \\nSnail Consumption by Hemigrapsus nudus \\n \\nThe crabs from the preference experiment were given five of each snail in each trial. \\nAfter 1.5 to 3 hours the number of snails consumed was counted and converted to a consumption \\nrate (snails consumed/hour). A total of eight feeding trials were conducted.  \\n \\nStatistical Analysis \\n \\nFor the morphometric analysis, crabs were divided into four groups based on sex and \\nspecies. Standardized major axis regression was used to determine the relationship between crab \\nmorphometric parameters. Arcsin transformations were used to correct for non-normality (Sokol \\nand Rohlf 2011). Differences in CW:PH and CW:PW were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA \\nCharifson 6 \\n \\nwith factors: Sex and Species. Prey selection by H. nudus was analyzed using G-tests for each \\nindividual that consumed snails. An one-way ANOVA was used to determine differences in snail \\nconsumption rates by H. nudus.  \\n \\nResults: \\nMorphometrics: \\n \\nCarapace width was a good predictor of both propal height (Figure 1, Table 1A) and \\npropal width (Figure 2, Table 1B) in female and male H. oregonensis and H. nudus.

There were no differences in snail consumption rates between \\nmale and female H. nudus of similar propal heights, mostly due to high feeding variation among \\nindividual crabs.  \\n \\nIntroduction: \\n \\nA multitude of species coexist in the marine intertidal environment. Closely related \\nspecies may be sympatric and compete for resources, such as food. Two species of shore crab, \\nHemigrapsus nudus (Dana 1851) and Hemigrapsus oregonensis (Dana 1851), occur in sympatry \\nin the Salish Sea. Both species are sexually dimorphic, with the males having larger chelae. \\nSpecies in sympatry may exhibit character displacement, the exaggeration of morphological or \\nbehavioral characteristics due to competition for resources (Brown and Wilson 1956). When H. \\nnudus and H. oregonensis co-occur, H. oregonensis tends to be found closer to the waterand in \\nfiner sediment than the more desiccation-tolerant H. nudus (Sliger 1982). There is still \\nconsiderable habitat overlap between these two species; the underside of a single rock may have \\nCharifson 3 \\n \\nroughly equal abundances of the two crab species (personal observation). The size of the chela \\nmay differ, which could allow the crabs to differentiate in food resource utilization. \\nBoth species are omnivores that eat algae and small invertebrates, including snails \\n(Behrens Yamada and', metadata={})]"

In \\ngeneral the ability of carapace width to explain the variance in chela size parameters (i.e.: R2 \\nvalues) was greater in females of both crab species (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2). Males may have \\nmore variation in claw size due to trade-offs between claw size and factors like feeding \\nefficiency or resource allocation. Trade-offs relating to chela size are found in fiddler crabs, \\nwhich exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. Fiddler crabs have a trade-off between the intrasexual \\ncompetition and intersexual signaling functions of the dimorphic claw (Swanson et al. 2013). \\nCharifson 8 \\n \\nThis is not to say that the particular trade-offs in fiddler crabs case are analogous to that of \\nHemigrapsus, since both claws in the two shore crabs in this study are used in feeding.  \\nSexual dimorphism in chela size, which is readily apparent to the eye in both \\nHemigrapsus nudus and Hemigrapsus oregonensis, was detected statistically (Figures 3 and 4). \\nThe two-way ANOVA with factors sex and species did not show a significant species effect, \\nsuggesting that the claws of both shore crabs produce roughly the same force and are \\nfunctionally equivalent (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1998). The lack of morphological \\ndifference in the size of the chelae between the crab species removes the possibility of character \\ndisplacement in the trait. It should be noted that this study was not designed to test for character \\ndisplacement, but to determine if this would be an interesting question for future investigations. \\nTo make a compelling case for character displacement it is necessary to compare multiple \\nsympatric and allopatric populations with similar abiotic and biotic conditions (Stuart and Losos \\n2013). Also it must be demonstrated that the trait differs due to genetic differences between \\nsympatric and allopatric populations, that the differences between the populations are not due to \\nspecies sorting, that the morphological trait is correlated to differences in resource use between \\nthe two sympatric species, and that the similar phenotype in allopatric populations compete for \\nthe same resources (Stuart and Losos 2013). The tendency of H. nudus to occupy the upper \\nintertidal zone (Sliger 1987), despite considerable overlap with H. oregonensis, may provide \\nenough differential resource use to prevent exclusion in sympatry.
