It was found that the two-way ANOVA with factors sex and species did not show a significant species effect, suggesting that the claws of both shore crabs produce roughly the same force and are functionally equivalent (Behrens Yamada and Boulding 1998). Additionally, the consumption rates of H. nudus for Littorina sitkana and Lacuna vincta were found to be 1.8 and 13.03/individual crab/day respectively, and there was no potential for character displacement of chela size in the sympatric species. There were also no differences in consumption rates between male and female H. nudus.

Step-by-step explanation:

The paper discusses the predation upon subtidal Tonicella lineata at Mussel Point, California (page 1).
It mentions that there is relatively little predation on Tonicella lineata at Mussel Point and there is significant discrimination against feeding on them in the laboratory (page 1).
The mechanism of protection against predation is not known, but it appears to be associated with the dorsal surface of living animals (page 1).
The paper reports on laboratory experiments and subtidal observations pertaining to the discrimination of nonvisual predators against Tonicella lineata and the possible reasons for the lack of predation (page 3).
It mentions that Tonicella lineata seems quite vulnerable to predation by nonvisual predators while situated on the Lithophyllum covered rocks in the Mussel Point kelp bed (page 4).
The paper suggests that difficulties encountered by starfish when removing Tonicella lineata from various substrates, lack of a chemical attractant, possession of a chemical repellent, or some form of a tactile inhibitor of predation may explain the low predation on Tonicella lineata at Mussel Point (page 12).","The paper is about predation on subtidal Tonicella lineata at Mussel Point, California.

The author also conducted a 2-hour subtidal observation period to observe the activities of Tonicella and associated fauna.
The author found that Tonicella are vulnerable to predation by nonvisual predators while situated on the rocks, but their abundance suggests that they are not heavily preyed upon.
