Figure S. A. (From MocClintock, 1967). Di6grom Showing the brientotion
of Shell loyers in 6 limpet Shell. The loyer lobelled "m"is the
myostracum(muscle Scar layer). B. Cross-section of the shell at the level
of the muscle scor, Showing that the myostracum originates on the innel
Surfoce of the shell where the "Scor" oppeors. A crob-like force would
produce tension at the inner Surface(the myostracum). P-PriSmS.

Figure 4. Bending caused by crab-like forces 6t the muscle Scor. The
colcium carbonate shell would tend to fracture first along the inner
Surfoce Since the shell is weoker in tension thon compression.
