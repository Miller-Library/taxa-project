DISCUGSION
FlatfIch poSS6St a large abllity to Change thelr pattcrnS to adapt to
nCW SubStrateS. The pattern 15 largely determined by the percent CoVer
Within Independent DatCh diStributions of two different DIGCht
Structures found In the Speckled Sanddab, melanophores and iridOphor65.
The mclanophore 1S a reticulate cell that can dicperSe or concentrate the
dark DIgment It ContalnS, GulCkly varying It5 contributlon to the
background Shadc. The iridophore contalnc intracellular layert of whlte
Quaninc CrStalS Which are fix6d In pOSItIon. IrIdOphoreS Cay not dulCKly
