Drc-aCcCl/matlon fOCky f1ch had an AVcraOc DatteTn SCOrc Of 1.75.
Whereas pre-acclimation Sandy fiSh had an average pattern Score of 4.48.
After the 8 day acclimation, rocky fiSh on rock became Sandler by a
dcgrce of 1.04; rocky fiSh on Sand became Sandler by 2.41 degree5. The
Sandy fiSh On Sand Showed an increase in SandineSS Of .46 d60r65.
WhercaS the Sandy f1Sh on rock became rockler by 63 dcgrecs (Sce Table
and figure5 4-8). One-talled, rank SUm two Sample teSt5 Show that
there 15 a Significant diffcrence between the pattern Change of
Cxperimental and Control fiSh (p-006 for rocky f16h, D-03 for Sandy
fISh, Sce Table 1.) After 8 dayS Of aCClimation, roCky f16h matched a
Sandy SubStrate better than Sandy fiSh matched a rocky SubStrate (S66

When Glven the cholce betwcen rocky and Sandy SubStrateS, foCky
control fiSh choce the Sand 56% of the trialS. Sandy Control fi6h
demonStrated a greater preference for Sand by chooSing the Sandy
SubStrate 76% of the trialS (Sce Table 2 and figurc 11) A Mann-Whithcy

At the collection Site for the Sandy fISh, the SubStrate CconSlSted of
