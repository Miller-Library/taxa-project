CONCIUS1ON
Rocky and Sandy SanddabS both demonStrated an ablllty to Chande
thelr pattern to adapt to novcl SubStrates. Rocky fich matched Sand
better after 8 dayS of accl/mation than Sandy fich matched rock, Which
WaS DrObably the reSult of the gencral trend for the f15h in the
cxperIment to become more Sandy. All fich diSplayed acpects of the
Same baSlc pattern of 1ridophorc Spot5, although the Dattern WaS mOre
DrOnOUnCed In the focky f15h. Since It 15 caSlly highlighted Or
dc-accentuated, Drobably by the action of melanophoreS, thic baSiCc
pattern ScemS to offer a great deal of flexibility to the Sanddab In
matching many gralnS of SubStratc5.
