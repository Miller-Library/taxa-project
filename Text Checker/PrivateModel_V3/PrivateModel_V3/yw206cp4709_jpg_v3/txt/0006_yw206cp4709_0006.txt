DiSCuSSion
ItSeemSreaconable to hypotheSize that the bottom habitat of the
Canddab might give it a kinematic advantage over more ffeely Swimming
fiches. The ground effect provided by the Solid ocean floor Imightallow the
uundulatory motions of the Canddab during liftoff to move it more quickly
than Cimilar motions could when ata diStance from a Solid SubStrate. To
Eain an equal acceleration, fich living in the water column would have to
move more water ata higher velocity than flatfich due to the extfa
diccipation of energy in open water that would not occur againcta Solid
Subctrate.
Since the Sanddab appeared to be conSiStentin both the frate of WaVe

any difference in dicplacement, velocity, or acceleration noted ic precumably
due to the difference in Cubctrate. CurpriSingly, all the data Collected point
