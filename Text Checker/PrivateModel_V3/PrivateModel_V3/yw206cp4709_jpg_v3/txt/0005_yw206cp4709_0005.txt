Ihillimeterc of each other. The average fatio of dictance from the noce to the
Center of Eravity divided by totallength of the fich Served to locate the
Center of gravity of the experimental fich without needing to measure it
directly. This center of gravity provided a convenientreference pointfor
ImeaSuring the dicplaccement, velocity, and acceleration of the Sanddab acit

The Canddab moved itc body in almoftidentical faShion When lifting

Thus, direct comparicon of displacements, velocities, and accelerationS
between liftoffS appears to be valid.
In cach liftoff, the fich held itc body off the Substrate, balancingaSa

fin. Once lateral movementhad begun, the dicplaCementin the X direction

between Subctrates even after the fich began moving rapidly upward (Figure
S). In each cace, the center of gravity of the fich moved about 7 Cm in cach
