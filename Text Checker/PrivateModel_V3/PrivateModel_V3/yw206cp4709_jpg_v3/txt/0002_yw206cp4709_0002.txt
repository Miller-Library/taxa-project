Introduction
The Sanddab (Sthafichthy borididuc ic a bottom dvwelling flatfich
Common in the waters of Monterey Bay. Like cthcr flatfich, the dictance
between its pectoral finsis quite Short while iti quite bide between its
dorSal and anal finS. Since it has cvolved to living On itS fightSide, it thus

Known to catSquid and bottom-dwelling CcruStaceans (B. HopkinS, perSonal

The dorcal and anal fins of the Pacific Sanddab freach nearly from itS
noce to itS Caudal fin, their fayS juStiong enough to touch the bottom around
the margin of the fich. ItS icft pectoral fin iSlafEc and ued for StEcfing and

Camouflaged in its favored Sandy bottom habitat fcatufing a highly
developed SyStem of chromatophores and iridophores on its upper Surface
for improving itS ability to blend with different SubStrates (A. DeCk, DeISonal
COmmunication). In addition, Sanddab thfow Sand on thcir bodics to furthcr
blend with their Substrate.
The pocture of the Sanddab hac a marked ceffect on its mode of
locomotion. In contrastto ficheS that Swim freely in the watr Coluimn,a
Sanddab commonly rects for long pcriods of time on the bottom, moving Only
