The Sanddab thus appears to be lifting itcelf off the SubStrate uSinga

any EIOund effect that the fiSh may alco be experiencing. There Seem to
remain three pocSibilities, or combinations of poSSibilities, for the chief
Imethod by which the Sanddab lifts itcelf off the SubStrate. Ohe poccibility iS

Sufrounding water is mainly responsible for its movement. Thics force Would
DuSh the fich horizontally through the water. Depending on the angle of
attack-the angle that the bottom of the fich makes with the horizontal
SubStrate-the fich Would Eain differing amountc of vertical lift ffom itS
horizontal thruct. The displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the
Sanddab would thus not depend directly on the Substrate. Aground effect.
CauSed by the Solid SubStrate, would Still affect lift but the experimental data
indicate that Such a contribution ic negligible
Alternatively, the main thruct imay be to the rear but not be hydraulic
atall. Itmay be that the dorSal and anal fin fayS, Whoce tipS lic along the
bottom like two bulldozer tread, move perictaltically to the rear to force the
fich forward. The reduced right pectoral fin mightalco Eive Some Small
Chove against the bottom. In thiS cace, as in the above poccibility, horizontal
movement would produce vertical lift becauce of the angle of attack the fich
preSentS to the water.
The third poSSibility is that the fich Eains a vertical normal force from
the Subctrate, but the nature of the ubstrate does notmatter. The bottom
