for its highly developed camouflage techniques: the namecake Sandit
throws on itc left tide to blend with its SubStrate imay retard its eccape When
threatened.
In contraSt the Sanddab may Eain locomotory advantages from living
On the bottom. Ueland (1984) tudied how the Sanddab isable to maintain
itS poSition in Swiftly moving Water, avoiding locomotion altogether, by
DOSitioning itcelf in certain postures on the Substrate. Interaction between
Ceawater moved by the Swimming Sanddab and the Solid Substrate, called
Eround effect. may allowit to move more efficiently than withoutan
interaction between the water and the SubStrate. Blake (1970) Ghowed that
the mandarin fich (Oymchropuis pictirstuu9 is able to hover imore efficiently
near a Solid Subctrate due to the ground cffect than it Could without the
Substrate.
This experiment Sought to deScfibe and quantify the effect of the
SubStrate on the movement of the Canddab through Ccomparing the liftoff of a
Sanddab from a Solid SubStrate, which WOuuld allow a Eround effect to oCCuf.
And a mech Subctrate, whoce porocity would preventa ground cffect ifom
Aiding in liftoff.
Materialc and Methodc
All experiment took place uSing a Single Sanddab (19Cm long. 101.5
E)in a 0.60 by 0.40m tank of Still Sea water, Changed daily. The fich WAS
CauEhtin the waters of Monterey Bay in the vicinity of HopkinS Mafine
Station, Pacific Grove, California. The fich ate Squid Several times a Week
during the experimental period.
