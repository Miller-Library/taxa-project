A 9 volt clectric prod diccharged at the extreme pocterior end of the
Caudal fin of the Sanddab, Cauced it to lift off from the Subctrate on which it
UAS Iying. A tipod-mounted Sony HandyCam video Camcordef, filmingat 30
frames per Second and 1/250 Sec per frame, recorded aliftoff cequence on
Cach of two differentSubctrates. In each cace, the depth of bater above the
SubStrate was 0.17m. No Sand waS available for the Sanddab to bury itcelf.
Recording Continued until the camera Captured the fich lifting off from both
Subctrates in a Similar fachion.
The colid Subctrate wasa Plexiglas SheetServingas the bottom of the
tank. The poroucSubctrate wasa Sheetof 1 1/2 mech galvanized
chickenwire recting 0.08 m off the bottom of the tank. The Sanddab
ApDeaIed to be equally comfortable on cach SubStrate, although the mech did
tend to ffay the dorSal, anal, and Caudal finS of the fich Slightly over time.
Playback of the two video Sequences on alarge-Screen televicion
provided large, clear imagec eaSily traceable onto acetate film. A digitizinE
Dad, fecording at centimeter intervals the pocition of the curved back of the
fich, converted the chape of the fich into Cartesian coordinates. Thece
COordinates provided values for the fadius of Curvature at each pointalong
