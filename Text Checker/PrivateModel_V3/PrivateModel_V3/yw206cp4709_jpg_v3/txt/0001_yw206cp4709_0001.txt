The flatifich (SthaficEthys oordiduus (Pacific Sanddab) isa bottom
dweller dependent on camouflage and quick eScape fesponse to protectit
ffom dangef. In an attempt to deterimine the nature of the Subctratetrole
in the quick liftoff of the Sanddab from the ocean bottom, an Cxperimental
fich lifted off alternately from a porous and a Solid SubStrate. The Sanddab
dicplayed Similar displacement, velocity, and acceleration vectors in both K-
and y-directions when lifting off ffom cither SubStrate. The Similafity of
hovementon both cubctrates indicates thata ground effect, or force cauced
by hydraulic flow redirected by the ncarby Solid SubStrate, iS of little
