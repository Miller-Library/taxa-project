Thc protocol of Wolf Bnd Quimby (1976) for gencr6l
diccociation of fich tifcuc for primary Culture vi a trypsin digeStion,
cVc for ouly 1 hour, led to cxceccive dissociation and Ccll dcath in thit
Study. Then 6 manual discociation wat ttcmpted using mocroclecirodCS,
but thece culturcs were too Sparccly plated, due to 6 lack of Sufficichtly
diccociated ticcuc. Thcy manual trituration with forccps was attcmpted,
but the culturcc wtrc too dcnscly plated with undiccociated tiSSuce
