FIGURE IEGENDS
Figure 1. Glutamate rcceptors ore cxpresced by hcurons os carly 6s Day 1
in Culture. Percentages of cell viability of culturec cxpoced to 1 mM
glutomate (lower line, t) were plotted ogainst percentages of the control
(upper linc, O). Ccll viabiliticc were already considcrably lower than
control voluces on Day 1. The relativcly high ccll viobility for Day 2 of
thc culture cxposed to glutamate could be cxplained by o high proportion
of Ccrcbellor NcuronS, Which arc knowy hot to txbrest glutomotc
FECeptors in mam/nalS.
Figure 2. Glutamate ncurotoxicity is cumulative. Control Cultures hod
viabilitics of 60% on Day 2 in culture. The higher the concentrotionS
4Sed, the greater the cell dcath obtcrved.

Figure Sa. Cell cultures expoced to glulamatc for 5 minutet were tected
for viability with trypan bluc the following d8y. After Pxpocure to 5 mMl
