that prevents the fich from Stimulating the chemoreceptorS to
cauSe nematocySt discharge. This is demonStrated by the
acclimation of my finger to the anemoneS. Another obServatlon
that SupportS thic theory was that even after acclimation, on the
rarc occaSion that the face of a fich hit an ancmone, the anemonc
alwayS cloced. If the fiSh was producing a protective mucus layer
Itoelf, the face would alco be protected. Since the face rarely
touched anemones, It did not accymulate cnough anemone muCuS
for protection.
The Painted Greenling Seems able to maintain thiS
protection through ito mucus layer for a long time. One f1Gh WaS
removed from its accl/mated anemonec for 11 dayc and waS Still
falrly acclimated upon return to the tank. Thio i5 qulte different
from the inability of Ampblorion bicinctus to remaln accl/mated
to Radlanthus koselrensic (Graefe, 1964). Gracfe oboerved that if
this fich was Seperated from itshoct anemone for 1 hour or more.
It would be Stung upon it5 return.
One main thceory behind mucus protection ic that the mucuS
doec not contaln any of the active chemlcals needed to trigger the
chemoreceptorS. Another clalmS that certaln chemicalcs inhiblt
nematocySt diScharge, DoSSibly by raloing the threchold to
mechanical Stimull. Finally, the anemone may recognize It Own
mucuS on the fiSh and identify the fioh ac part of ltoelf.
It SeemS very unlikcly that the mucus containc inhlbltors to
nematocySt diocharge. If Inhlbltors were precent in the ancmonct
mucuS layer, they would interfere in the anemone's normal feeding
and protective reactionS.
One cxperiment that may Support the lack of excitatory
factors was the teSting of greenling body bartS with anemOncS.
While Some finS cauced a notable difference in reactions between
accllmated and nonaccllmated anemones, others did not. ThoSc
