Hopkins Marine Station was put in a tank with two different cloncS
of C californica one orange and one pink, neither of which had
been prevlouSly in a tank with fich. AS time paSed, the cloSure
values for the orange clone decreaced, Showing accl/mation. TheSe
valueS are liSted in Table +1 and graphed in figure +1. In the firSt
75 hour5, there were only 9 obServed contacto with the pink
anemoneS, So cloSure values were not calculated for indivldual
Obcervation periodS. Of thece O hit5, 4cauced complete CloSure
while 5 cauced anemonec to clocc 1/2 (a combined clocure valuc of
2.4). However, in the 80 hour and 89 hour obServation perlod5,
there were more hlt5 and closure values of 0.2 and 1.0 were found
Thic demonStrates the greenlingS ability to accl/mate to more
than one clone at a time.
Interesting reSultS were found when a greenling WaS
accllmated to the orange anemones in one tank, moved to ancW
tank wlth pink anemones, and then returned to the origlnal tank 11
dayS later. The original acclimation cloSure values with the
Orange anemoneS Can be found in Table K2. Figure +2 ShowS the
Clocure values when the fioh i5 put in and taken out of the firSt
tank, when the fich ic put in the Second tank, and when it i6
returned to the original tank. Note that after 11 day5, the fi6h
waS Still falrly acclimated (cloSure value5 for hit hard, hit, and
bruched were 1.0, 0.B1, and 0.6 respectively).
It IS alco interesting to follow different Situations for a
particular group of C. californica One at a time, four fiSh Were
introduced to the clonal groups of anemones in one of the tankS
(6XD. 6, 7 (Table +2), 8, 810). Figure +3 GhowS the cloSure valuc6
calculated from the firSt observation period for cach of theSe four
fi9h (2 greenlingS, a SnubnoSe Sculpin, and then another greenling).
fach greenling had been prevloucly iSolated and all were
approximately the Same Size, yet the cloSure valueS Uupon
