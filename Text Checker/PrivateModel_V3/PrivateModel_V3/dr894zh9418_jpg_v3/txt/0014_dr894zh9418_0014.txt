waS killed. If the fins were covered with Something that inhibited
nematocySt discharge, the contamination Should not have CauSed
all anemones to react the Same. Even if the contamination
contained chemicals that were active enough to override the
Inhibition (lower the threchold to mechanlcal Stimull more than
the inhibitors ralced 1t), the reactionc of acclimated anemoncS
Should Still have been Somewhat less than thoce that were not
affected by the inhibitors at all. Inhibltion muSt not be the
mechanism. On the other hand, if the mucus layer merely
contalned no active chemicals, contamination would be expected to
cauce Similar reactions by both accl/mated and nonaccllmated
ancmoneS. It 1S Still posoible, however, that there WaS merely a
lack of mucus on the areas touched agalnSt the anemoneS. ThIS
would alco cauSe all anemones, accllmated or not, to react the

The moSt likely mechaniom for protection iS that the
anemone recongnizes the fich as part of itSelf. All observationS
agree with thic expanation. For example, conSider that any
particular greenling can acclimate to more than one clonce of C.
californica at a time. An acclimated fich put in a tank with a
different clone of anemones will be entirely unacclimated. So
cven if there are no active chemlcals to cauSe diocharge of the one
clone, another clone will react. A fISh in a tank with two cloneS
Would pick up mucus from both clones. ASSuming that the lack of
active chemicals cauces protection, thlS combined mucuS Should
Still contain chemicals from each clone that are active. enough to
cauce diccharge on the other clone. If, however, cach clone giveS
the fich mucus that It can recognlze, the fich will be recongnlzed
by both and will not cause nematocySt discharge on either. This 15
