In arecent publication, The Biolooy of NematoCySt5
(Thorington and HeSSinger). Thorington and Hessinger deScribed
their Study of nematocySt diocharge and liSted Some of the factorS
affecting this diScharge. LIke moSt reScarchers of nematocySt5,
they found that concomitant mechanlcal and chemical Stimulation
of the cnidocytes is required to initiate or trigger the diScharge
of the cnldae. The cnidocytes are Speclallzed Secretory cells on
the tentacles that are also considered independent effectors and
directly perceive Stimull for diScharge.
The mechanism for discharge involves chemocenSitization of
the cnldocytes by the active chemicals, which then lower the
mechanical threshold of cnida discharge. Chemical Stimulation
alonc has occasionally been found to cause discharge, but only
under more Stringent conditionc (uSing very harSh chemicalS) than
are found in the natural environments of the anemones. In Some
anemone tentacles mechanical Stimulation alone Can CauSe Some
diScharge, but in every case adding approprlate chemical
Stimulation to mechanical Stimulation cauSes much greater
diScharge. Some of the active chemicals have been iSolated and
include n-acetylated Sugars and various amino CcompoundS.
N-acetylated Sugars are common in the mucus layers of many
organiSmS that are prey for anemones. TheSe SugarS CauSe
immediate discharge on contact with the tentacles. Then, after
nematocySts have plerced the prey, body fluldc contalning
numerous amino compounds are released and Stimulate further
diScharge.
For years cnidocytes were conSidered independent effectorS
with direct control over the cnidae diocharge and no intervention
of the nervous SyStem. Certaln observationS, however, Show thal
the nervous SyStem SceemS tohave either a modulatory or an
inhibitory influence on cnidae discharge. For example, a
