anemones closed. The only reactions obServed were occaSional
Sllght retractionS.
Another interesting obServatlon wac the abundance of
Snubnose Sculplns (Orthonoplias triaci6) and Blackeyed GoblcS
(Coryiphopterus nicholsi) on the Same rocks as the greenlingS and
C. californica. A Snubnoce Sculpin wac once Seen with Ito pectoral
fin on an ancmone that was Still open. Finally, a Northern
Spearnoce Doacher (AgonopSic cmmelane) waS found resting On
four anemones. I pulled him off by the tall andreleaced him. He
Immediately returned to the anemones, none of whlch Showed any
reaction.
RESULTS: TAK OBSERVATIONS
Nith Anthoplcura:
A Painted Greenling with bubble diccacc was placed in a
Small tank with the three Anthopleura. In the firSt hour, the fi6h
made contact with only the tentacles  time5. In all S caSe5, the
anemonec reSponded with a fceding motion; the tentacles rolled in
toward the mouth and then immedlately back out. Then, as the fi6h
died an hour later, it landed in one of the A Manthogrammitca
twice. Both timec the anemone attempted to cat the fich (6XD. K1).
The other greenling teSted with Anthopleura waS in a much larger
tank. It Stayed in the far left 1/3 of the tank, away from the
anemoneS, for the entire week of obcervation (Map +4).
Simllar fceding reSponScc were oboerved both timeS a
Clinocottus analic touched an Anthopleura (cxp. K4). But unllte
the Painted GreenlingS, Wooly Sculpinc were often Seen reting On
the pedal diSc5 and columnS of theSe ancmOncS.
Nith Corynactis californica:
All the Palnted GreenlingS that acclimated to C talifornica
did So In approximately 3-5 dayS. For example, a greenling fror
