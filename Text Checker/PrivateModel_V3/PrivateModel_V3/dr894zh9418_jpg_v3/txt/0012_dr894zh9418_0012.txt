less than the previously iSolated anemones. But for the talls of
both fich and the ventral fin of the firSt fih, there is little or no
differencc, DoSSibly due to contamination by blood when the f16h
had ito Spinal cord Cut.
AS a final cxperiment, acclimated my index finger toa
clone of C californica After ten minutec of rubbingmy finger On
Cloced anemone5, 1 wac able to lightly touch the tentaclec of an
opened anemone on the Same rock without cauSing a reaction. If 1
then touched thic anemone with a different finger, the anemone
WOuld cloce. The accllmated finger was covered by a Slimy
SubStance that muSt have been anemone mucuS. It 16 thiS muCuS
that protected my finger from nematocySt diScharge.
DISCUSSION AND CONCIUSIONS
ObServationc with Anthopleura Show that fich did not
acclimate to the tentacles of celther A clegantiSsima Or A.
Manthogrammica. Palnted GreenlingS avold theSe anemoncS
completely. Wooly SculpinS, On the other hand, merely avold the
tentacles. They wlll rest on both the pedal diSc and column of an
anemOne, and were even Seen uSing an anemone for protection in
the field. If contact with Anthopleura tentacles does oCcCur,
howcver, the anemone wIll attempt to cat the f16h.
It 1S alSo clear that Painted GreenlingS (and probably
Northern Spearnoce Doachers, Snubnose SculpinS, and mayb6
Blackcyed Goblc5) do acclimate to the Strawberry Anemone,
Corynactis californica. ThiS accllmation period take6
apDrOximately 3-5 d8y5.
The acclimation process SeemS to occur through two maln
mechanismS. The firSt involves a change in the mucus layer of the
fi9h. Though there have been clalms that the fih Secretes the
protective SubStances, it ScemS more lIkely that the flch plcKS UD
anemone mucuS through repeated contact. It 1S thic mucuS layef
