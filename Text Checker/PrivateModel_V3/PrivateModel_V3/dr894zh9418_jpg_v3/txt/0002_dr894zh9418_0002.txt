ABSTRACT
Although there have been many Studies on the relationhip5
between certain fich and Sea anemones in the troplc, very little
1S Known about the fich-anemone interactionc in the colder waterS
of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. After a Seven week
investigation in Monterey Bay,I found that none of the fiSh
obServed will acclimate to the tentaclec of either of the intertidal
Sca ancmoneS Anthoplceura xanthogrammica or Anthopleura
clegantiScima, althouoh the Wooly Scudlpin (Clinocottus analiS)
will rest on the bace or colymn of cither.
I alco found that the Painted Greenling (OÎ¼ylebluc plctu6), a6
Well as other rock dwelling fich, will acclimate to the Strawberry
Anemone (Corynactis californica). The acclimation proceSS takeS
apprOximately 3-5 day5, depending on the amount of contact
between the acclimating fich and the anemone5, and the amount of
previous contacts with the anemones by other fiSh. There are tWwo
mechanisms involved in the acclimation proces5. FirSt of all,
through repeated contact, the fich plckS up mucus from the
ancmones and addc it to ito own mucus layer. ThiS CauSes cach
ancmone to recognize the acclimated fiSh as a part of itSelf and
prevents the fich from Stimulating the anemone'S chemoreceptor5
for nematocySt discharge. Secondly, the ancemones become
habituated to contact by the fiSh.
INTRODUCTION
There are two fich that were concentrated on during thiS
Study. The firSt were the Wooly SculpinS, ClincottuS analiS
Thece fich inhabit the intertidal and Shallow Subtidal zones. The
are found from Bala, California to Cape Medocino, California and
are extremely abundant in the tidepools and ShallowS at HopkinS
Marine Station in Montercy.
