Thic implles Some type of mechanlcal habituation by the anemoncS
to repeated contact by fi6h.
Another example of thic mechanlcal habituation iS the
acclimatlon perlodc of the Second and third grecnlingS mentioned
above. The third greenling was entirely accl/mated after 72hour5.
The Second greenling, however, waS only partially accl/mated.
after 72hours and was not fully acclimated until over 100 hour5
after introduction to the tank. Thi 1 a16o Shown in FIGure 43.
Finally, 1 looked at all the "hlt hard' contacto throughout IH)
ObServationS. For each contact, counted how many times that
particular anemone had been hit before. For anemones that cloced,
they had previoucly been hit an average of 1.6 times. Ancmone
that cloced 1/2 had been hit an average of 40 timeS, while Slight
retraction anemones had been hit an average of 5.5 time5. Thi6
Shows the mechanical habituation by individual anemoneS.
