The final experiment done with C californica involved an
attempt to acclimate my finger to a clonal group of anemones from
the Shalcbed5. I rubbed the end of my index finger agalnSt 1/2 of
the anemones (which were cloced) and then tested the reactions of
Open anemones to my touch.
RESULTS FIEIDOBSERVATIONS
both Anthopleura xanthogrammicaand Anthopleura
cleqantiScimawere Studied in the tide pools of Hopkin Marine
Station. The only contact ever Seen inyolved a Wooly Sculpin and
an A. Manthogrammica The Sculpin waS Sitting on the column of
the ancmone, approximately 1/2 way between the oral and pedal
dicc5. Another observation involved an A. Manthogrammica four
Wooly SculpinS, and a Monkey Faced Eel. The anemonc WaS
attached to avertical rock Surface just above the bottom of the
pool Such that ito tentacles reached the bottom. This formeda

anemone'S tentacles. By putting anet on one Side of the anemone
and Sticking my hand under on the other Side, captured the four
Sculpins and the cel. Finally, a fellow Student found a bead that
She had used to mark a Small Clinocottuc analic near the mouth of
an ancmone in one of her Study tide poolS.
All field obServations with C californica Were madc USing

fairly large greenling waS found at 8 meterc on a field of
anemones covering approximately one Square meter. USing my
