Swimming anemone, Stompbia coccinca, Will not capture any prey
while its pedal disc is detached from the SubStratum. It was alSo
found, uSing coverslip5 coated with food extract and the anemone
Anemonia SargaScenSiS, that tactile Stimulation of the body
column increases the amount of discharge. Even the amblent light
intenSity, though cnidocytes are not conSidered to be
photocensitive, affects the responSiyness of cnidocytes and the
ability to capture prey. Other factors influencing the
phySiological State of the anemones, Such as ions in the ambient
medium and the amount of recent feeding, alco Seem to affect the
amount of cnidae diScharge (Thorington and HeSSinger).
The acclimation process between anemonefish and their
hoSts has been Studied for year5, but moSt of these Studies have
taken place in the tropicc where the fich actually lives within the
tentacles of a Single host. There are a few different theorlcS on
how the acclimation takes place.
The first Set of theories aSSumes that the anemone makeS
certaln changes and iS responSible for the acclimation (Gohar).
They feel that the anemone changes or inhibits its pattern of
nematocySt discharge due to the behavjoral, phySical, or chemical
Stimull of the accl/mating fiSh.
Contrary to these are the theoriec in which the fich i6
responSible for its protection from the anemones by in Some Way
changing its mucus layer. Some feel that the mucus layer after
acclimation contains no active agents or other factors which are
Known to Stimulate the chemoreceptor5, causing nematocySt
diScharge Upon contact (Lubbock). Others feel that certain
chemicals in the mucus layer inhibit nematocySt diScharge
(Davennport & NorriS). This inhibition can occur in one of tWo
wayS. There ic cither direct inhibition of the
cnidocyte-nematocySt complex on the tentacle5, or thio inhibltion
