iS accomplished through the organiSm'S nervous SyStem.
The final theories asSume that the mucus of the anemone iS
tranSferred to the accllmating fiSh. One German reScarcher,
Schlichter concluded in 1976 that SubStances which inhibit
hematocySt diScharge are produced by the anemones themSelves
(MariScal). Through repeated contact, the acclimating fiSh coatS
its body with this inhibitor as to no longer induce nematocySt
diccharge. Another poSsible explaination is that the anemone
identifles the acclimated fiSh as a part of itelf by recognizing It5
Own mucuS on the fiSh.
MATERIALS ANUD METHODS
All of the Clincottus analisused were collected from
tidepools during low tide at Hopkins Marine Station. All other fich
tested (Oxylebius pictus, Coryphopterus nicholSii, and OrthonopiaS
triaci6) were captured with anet from depths of 5-10 meters at
HopkinS Marine Station, the breakwater, or lovers Point, all of
which are located in Monterey Bay.
For TeSto With Anthopleura:
In each experiment l used a tank with two A Kanthogrammica
and one A. clegantissima, with approximate diameters of 15, 10.
and 10 centimeters respectively. All three anemones were
carefully removed from rocks in the intertidal zone of HopkinS
Marine Station. They were left in 1Solation for one week before
any experimentation was Started, In whlch time they Settled on
rocks in the obServation tank. During obServational cxperimentS
(watching fiSh in tankS with anemones), all contactS and reactionS
were noted, described and timed. In the experiment with forced
contact between anemones and Wooly Sculpins (ClingcottuS
anali6), the Sculpinc were held by the law with forceps and placed
tall firSt on one Side of the ring of tentacles. Care waS taken not
to touch the fiSh with my handS.
