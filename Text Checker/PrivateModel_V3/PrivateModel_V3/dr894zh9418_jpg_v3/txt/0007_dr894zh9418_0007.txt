For TeStcWith Corynactic californica:
One rock of C californica WaS collected from a depth of 8
meters at the breakwater of Monterey Bay. All other rockS were
collected from the Del Monte Shalcbeds of Monterey Bay at depthS
of 13-16 meterS. For all obervational experiment5, tankS Would
be watched for a couple hours and then left for a fcw hourS
repeatedly over Several days. All rocks with C californica were
mapped Such that individual anemones could be accounted for (See
MapS1-3).
During a glven observation period, all contactS were recorded
by anemone number and type of contact. Three types were used: hit
hard, hit, and brushed. One of four types of reactions by the
anemone waS then recorded cloced, cloced 1/2, Slight retraction,
or none. When an anemone cloced, the amount of time before
Opening WaS alSo marked for Some experimentS. For any
obServation period, a "closure value" could be calculated. Each of
the reaction types was aSSigned anumber cloced-3, CloSed
1/2-2, Slight retraction-1, and none-0. For all contacts in a
period, thece numbers were added up and divided by the total
number of contacts. This would result in a cloSure value between
0 and 3.
One experiment uSing various parts of Painted GreenlingS
waS alSo done. A fich was captured in a clean glaSS bowl to
prevent contamination. The fich was then placed on its Side in a
clean pan, keeping ito tail up with forcep5. The Spinal cord juSt
behind the head was qulckly Severed and the tall and Side facing 4p
were left uncontaminated. The pectoral fin, ventral fin, and tall
were then removed and tested on anemones. The anemones were
put in luSt enough water to cover them Such that the body parto
could be touched to anemones without letting the areas cut touch
the water. This prevented internal body fluidS from entering the
