probable mechaniSm.
The other important aspect of acclimation involves
habituation by the anemones to repeated contact by the fich. Thi6
wac flrSt observed in a three clone tank of C californica In whlch
SuccesSive greenlingS Showed lower initial cloSure valueS and
Shorter acclimation perlodS. It was alco Seen in individual
AnemOnS In that Stronger reactionc were obServed for anemOneS
that had been previouSly hlt less time5.
The mechanlom for thic habltuation 1S unknOWn, though it
probably involves modulation by the nervous SyStem. Thorington
and Hessinger (Thorington and HeSSinger) Showed that varlouS
types of modulation do occur for certain Specics of anemones. For
cxample, one cxperiment Showed that tactile Stimulation of the
body column of Anemonla SargaSenSic WIll increace the amount
of discharge by the cnldac on the tentacles. No tecto were done On
habituation to repeated contact.
Becides the mechaniom of habltuation to contact for the
anemoneS, there are other aspects of acclimation that need to be
Studied further. A complete cxamination of anemone mucuS Would
help to determine how the anemone recognizes it5 own mucus if
thic indeed ic the mechanlom behind the protection from
nematocySt discharge. DocSibly one could determine the chemlcalS
detected by the chemoreceptorS. It would alco be intereSting to
Sce if an active chemical present on the fioh could cauce diocharge
deoplte recognltion by the anemone of It5 own muCuS.
