The other fich Studied were Painted 6reenlingS (alSo called
the convict fiSh), Oxylebjus pictus. TheSe fiSh llve at depthS
ranging from juSt below the intertidal to 50 meters along the
northeastern Pacific coast from Bala California to Britich
Columbia. They live under the canopy forming brown kelp
MacrocyStic pyrifera. Adult greenlingS are reSidential, USually
Occupying areas less than 10 Square meters (DeMartini), and feed
from the rocks on avaricty of invertebrates, cespecially
CruStaceanc and WormS (Burgess and Axelrod).
Two intertidal Species from the order Actiniariawere uced
in this Study: Anthopleura xanthogrammicaand Anthoplcura
clegantiscima. They each have Strongly adherent bases andhave
ColumnS covered with verrucae, which are cvaginations with
modified ectoderm and no nematocysts which are able to cling to
Such thingS as rocks and Shells (Carlgren). They have large, Strong
tentacles and can therefore catch fairly large prey. Both practice
dioccious reproduction, although A. clegantissima alSo has the
ability to reproduce by longitudinal fiSSion, forming aggregationS
of a Single clone (SebenS). They are partlally Supported by the
Symblotic algae Zooxanthellea (fricSe).
The other anemone Studied was the Strawberry Anemone,
Corynactis californica. This anemone-like Species is in the order
Corallimorpharia. It iS morphologlcally S/milar to coralS, but it
lacks any Skeleton. It has a Smooth column and thin tentacles with
acroSpheres at the distal endS. Acrospheres are globular endS of
tentacles contalning numerous potent nematocyStS (Carlgren).
Thic anemone ic very abundant in Montercy Bay and occurs in
Callfornla from San Dlego to Sonoma County. It i5 found in Shaded
areas from the low intertidal to 30meterS. Corynactis californica
reproduces acexually by longitudinal fiSSion and ic found in clonal
OrOupS (Hand).
