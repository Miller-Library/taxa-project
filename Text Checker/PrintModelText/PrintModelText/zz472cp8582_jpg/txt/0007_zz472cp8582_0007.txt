1) When C. camaliculatum was attacked by a tube foot from
helgw its pesition on the substratum (i.e., an the back
af its foot), it ran up, away from the Eyenapedia (Fig. 6).
When the snail was stimulated at its head by the tube
foct, it displayed a substratum release response (hig. 7)
3) Upen landing upside-dewn an the harizental surface, U.
canaliculatum tried immedistely to right itself. When
tauched again by the tube feat befere turning ever, the
animal just retracted, pulsed out exudate, and pulled all
the way inte its shell (Figs. S,9). Me faat-shell rataticn
waz ebzerved in these snails.
4) If the animal was given the chance to right itself, it ran
in any direction with its tentacles wildly reaching eut
for input. If stimulated with a tube fect the snail
eshibited the same horizontal respenses already described.
In addition, all snails, regardless of what surface they were
attached to, responded anly when actually touched by the tube
feet.
Secretion Frecuetienmem
Fig. 10 shows the amount of exudate produced did nat depend on
the food source aver the twelve day experimental period, but rather
that the major factor in C. canaligulatu's regeneration of the
exudate was the time it was given to de so. Alse, as the time
hetween induced secretion was increased so did the strength of the
Eyenepodia reaction to it (Fig. 11).
Of eighty criginal snails that were induced to slime on the
day they were captured, ten of these did not produce the yellow
exudate. The second batch of forty snails that were left in the
identical tanks for ane week before being induced to secrete produced
a 1007 positive response, as appesed to the 87.5% of snails in the
