GEQUF 3 - anails 'd li-is were induced to secrete
avery 3 days
GEOUF 4 - snails 4'd 1-2O were induced te secrete
averyday
The test was conducted for twelve days. Each time a snail underwent
the precess of "being slimed" the amaunt of secretion released was
yisibly determined by the ameunt af yellow product that appeared in
the seawater mixture and recorded. The follewing relative scale was
used te quantify the results:
O pane secrt
paneweak amaunt sereec
waaamaunt ect
3 weak-maderate amaunt secreted
4 z naderate amaunt secreted
Sm mederate-strang ammunt ewreted
z strang ameunt secreted
The "Ã©" on the scale was equivalent to the amount of exudate
sscreted from the average snail just captured from the ccean.
After gellecting the exudate in Mppendorf tubes and labelling
them, a bicassay was run on a live Eycnepedia. The same seastar
was used for all bielegical tests the Pycnepodia was remeved trom
its holding tank and placed in a container (approximately 12" x 6"
3 5") with seawater. A control was run using SOul of ordinary
seawater and "shecting" it at the tip of ane arm af the Eyenepedia te
cbserve the response. The test consisted of expesing an arm ef the
seastar to a SOul sample (e.g., the pooled collection from snails 1-:
frem the Kelp tank on May S was ane sample, etc.) af the secretion
and recording the response on a O-o scale of the strength of behavior
response (Fig.1). The Pycnepedia was then rested for 5 minutes
Befare the next SOul sample was administerec.
Finally, after the twelve day testing peried the snails were
