MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eaperimental Animals:
Calligstoma ganaliculatum and Eyengpadia heliantheides (Hera-
after Eycnapadia) were collected in the kelp beds off of Hopkins
Marine Life Refuge (HMLR) an Feint Cabrille, Pacific Grove,
California using SCUBA. The C. canaliculatum were mest often
feund feeding on the blades af the brown alga Macrecystis
pymifema and occasionally on the red alga Sigartins
garymbifera on the sandy bottom.
Behavieral Experiments:
A total of thirty C. canaliculatum were used to determine a
characteristic escape response to Pycnepedia. The snails were kept
in running seawater tanks with plenty of kelp to feed on. One snai!
at a time was placed in an 8'x 4'x 2' seawater tank where a
Eycnepedia was being held. Individual tube feet were removed from
the seastar using forceps and then applied to varying parts of the
snail so the behavioral response could be observed. A whole Pyenamed
was alseldaittpaalilattevei
that the response was the same as that observed when the individual
tube feet were used. The snails were divided inte twe groups of
fifteen and placed an either a horizental or vertical substratum
within the tank. After observations were made, the tested snail was
placed in a seperate holding tank than the untested ones. Unce a
characteristic response could be predicted, illustrations were made
(Fiss. 2-9) to demonstrate the escape mechanism.
