DISCUSSION
Behavieral Experiments:
One problem I encountered with these studies was the
reluctance of the Fyenapodia to naturally forage after the C.
canaliculatum in aquaria. Attempts were made to induce the seastar
inte meving in the general direction of the snail placed in the tank
mut to no avail. Therefore, the technique using individual tube
feet described abave was used to simulate an attacking seastar.
With a nutural predatery event there would be more variability in
timing and persistence. The described behavier represents a
hierarchy of responses to a sustained attack. It would be of great
interest ta ebserve the behavier in the field te decument its form,
success, and ether consequences.
I noticed that for all thirty snails tested the secretion af
the exudate was a last ditch technique used to escape. The C.
canaliculatum were very reluctant to release the product. Also, I
aften found the snails halding an the substrate with the anterier pa
af their feet, while the ventral side af the posterior part af their
feet wrapped up onte the dorsal surface of their shells. This has
beem ebserved in Ca ligatum as well (Harrold, 1981), and is
apparently used te maintain a mucus layer an the shell. Therefore,
