the cbserved shell retation reaction must have several functions:
1) It makes it even more difficult for the starfish to get a
seed grip an the snail due te its mucus-layered shel.
It samersaults the snail out af the pathway af the
starfich (Altheuch in Harrald, 181, this behavier in
C.ligatum was not toc effective unless the snail was near
aledge).
3) Finally, it wraps the yellow exudate around the snail so
that whenever the zeastar attempts to grab hald at the
prey it is in censtant contact with the noxious substance.
The substance also sticks to the mucus trail that the running snail
lays down, therfore the Fycnepedia is faced with the secrection while
still in pursuit of its meal.
The release response I observed alse illustrates the extent
to which C. ganaliculatum will ge to avoid using the exudate to
escape. On the vertical zurface the responze differs when centacted
from abeve or belew. It weuld be maladaptive to release and fall
inte the multiarmed Eyanepedia, however the snail gains escape
yelccity by releasing its held on the substrate and falling when
attacked from above. This would work on either a vertical reef tace
er on those rare calm eccasions when Pycnepodia climbs kelp to forage
(Baxter, personal communication). Of course, when a snail releases
and falls it may be placing itself in jeopardy from the tentacles of
a waiting anemone, and this is ancther petential predater which may
he defeated by the hypebranchial secretion.
Once C. canaliculatum secreted its hypobranchial slime and
retracted all the way back inte its shell, the animal remained
pulled in for upwards of 30-3 minutes sometimes, even when they
were no langer being proveked by a simulated Eyenepedia. his
