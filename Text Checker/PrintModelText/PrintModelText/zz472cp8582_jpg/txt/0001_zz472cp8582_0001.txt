ABSTRACT
The gastropod Calliestema gamaliculatum demonstrates a violen
ape espane ta the aa Pypedia hellianthide he
escape mechanism is a highly complex series of reactions that
culmenates in the secretion of a noxious yellow substance from the
animal's hypebranchial gland. The extent to which C. ganaliculatum
will ge te escape from Fygnepedia without using the secretion
demonstrates a general reluctance to use the methed if it can be
aygided. The source of this excretion appears to be endogenous to
C. canaliculatum and does not come from its diet. Once secreted, the
snail needs between 4-7 days te regenerate the substance te its full
capacity, but four days appears to be sufficient for the
effectiveness of the zubstance to reach its full strength.
