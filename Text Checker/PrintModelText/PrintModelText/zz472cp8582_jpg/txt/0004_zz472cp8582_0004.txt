Secretion Production Experiments:
A total of eighty C. camaliculatum (different from the thirty
used in the above experiments) were cellected en Hay 4, 1988 and
induced to release the yellow substance that day. To collect the
exudate, a snail was held with the aperature up while a Fyenepedia
tube foct was applied to the head of the animal. The snail then
retracted inte its shell while secreting the product mixed in
seawater. This mixture was cellected using a micrepipet and
stared in a refrigerated flask.
The snails were then randemly divided inte four groups at
twenty and placed inte seperate running seawater tanks, each
centaining a different focd source:
TANK 1 = Kelp with blades encrusted by sessile
invertebrates
TOMH 2 = Kelp with ne invertebrate
TAiai yiea
lancealata
TARM 4 = Me Fecd
All of the kelp, Hacrocystis pymifema, and red algae, Gigartina
corymbifera, were collected off of HMLR using SCUBA. Invertebrates
were remaved from the kelp used in TOMK 2 by checsing ycunger
sections of fronds and washing them off and scrubbing them dewn.
Twenty-four haurs later five snails were remeved fram each tari-
and numbered 1-5. These were then induced to release their exudate
using the method descriped above. This process was continued to
produce four sampling regimes within each tank:
GHOUF 1 - snails 4'd i-S were induced to secrete
every day
GROUP  - snailz 'd 4-10 were induced to secrete
avery a days
