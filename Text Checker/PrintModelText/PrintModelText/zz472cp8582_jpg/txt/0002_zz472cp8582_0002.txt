INTRODUCTION
The gastreped Calliestama camaliculatum is one of many species
af Mallusca that exhibitz an escape respenze when pravaked by an
asteroid (Bulleck, 13; Feder, 1763,167; Mentgemery, 167 Mauz,
et al., 1768; Fhillips, 1774; Daytom et al., 1977; Meitza and
Fhillips, 1979; Abbatt and Haderlie, 1980; Harrald, 1981, 1982:
Herrlinger, 1783; Watanabe, 1783). C. canaliculatum reacts
particularly vielently to the seastar Eyenspedia heliantheides.
Many of the initial stages of this escape respense are shared with
ather snails of this genus (Harreld, 1781; Herrlinger, 1783), but
Ca canaliculatum also secretes a moxious yellow substance from its
hypebranchial gland when stimulated by Eygnepedia (Baxter and Gilly,
personal communication). This added feature to the typical
Calliestama genus escape mechanism appears to be quite effective.
Herrlinger, 1983, reperted that althaugh gastrepeds made up 77 af
the typical Eymmepedia's diet, enly abeut 1.54 of these were
C. canaliculatum compared to Ca ligatum which makes up almest 25 ot
the gastropods eaten. C. ligatum does not display the secretion of
the yellow substance.
The objectives of this study were to extensively observe the
stages of C. manaliculatum's escape mechanism from Eyenepodia, to th
extent that it became predictable, and to determine the source af th
noxicus exudate as being derived from the snail's diet of the kelp
Macrecystis pyrifera, the red algae Gigartina gomymbifema, and the
encrusting invertebrates present on these plants (Hunt, 1977
Sellers, 1977; Abbott and Haderlie, 1780) er from some endegencus
