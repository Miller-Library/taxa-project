C
the secretion (Smaby, personal communication).
SUMMARY
The purpese of this study was to figure out the dynamics af the
escape response that C. ganaliculatum exhibits in the presence of the
predator Eycnopedia, in terms of both the behavioral and production
mechanisms. It appears that the diet af the snail has no impact an
its ability to generate a volatile secretion. C. ganaliculatum can
redenerate the substance in large and effective quantities, but this
requires over four days to achieve maximum ameunt and titer. Ameunt
of secretion in the experiment were measured by eye in terms af the
yellowness of the mixture. It would be more accurate to develep a
spectrophatometris method. It appears that the active ingredient
dees not necessarily lie in the yellow factor because the strongest
reactions in the bidassay were ebserved aven theugh the ancunt
secreted did not reach the peak on the scale. If the active compeund
(er compounds) can be identified a quantitative measure can be
developed. The snail also goes through a rigorous patterns of
predictable actions before it will exude the substance, suggesting
quite a bit of reluctance in using this mechanism unless absolutely
