returned to the Bay and forty new C. manaliculatum were collected.
These were divided up inte graups af ten and placed in the faur
tankz mentiened abeve. This hatch was nat induced te secrete the
slime before heing placed inte the tanks. After ane week, all
forty snails underwent the secretien precess, and amounts and
bicassay recordings were made as described abave.
RESULTS:
Mehavieral Experimen
A predictable escape respense was determined for .
camaliculatum from Pyenapadia on both horizental and vertical
surfaces. On the harizental zubstratum the follewing was
abserved:
1) When a Exenepedia tube foct was touched to the head
tentacles of C. ganaliculati, the snail quickly turned
auay from the stimulated area (Fiq. 2).
2) When "attacked" from behind C. canaliculatum lifts up its
shell and begins to ru away. Approximately 50 af the
snails tested in this maner released the hypebranchial
secretien while they wers rumning, and this tends to
stick to the snail's shell and mucus trail (Fig. 3).
3) Ofter repeated stimulation from behind, the soail begins
te ratate its shall back and forth while threwing its fact
adainst the substratum gausing a semersaulting reactien
away from the Fyenapadia. In 100 of animals tested, the
yellaw secretion respense takes place in canjuticr
with this movement, wrapping arcund the snail as it
retates (Fig. 4).
Once on its back the snail continues to rotate its foot
until it is stimulated again by the tube fest. Ot this
point the animal retracts mest af the way into its shell,
dives a final pulse that shects out mare exudate, and
pulls all the way back into its shell (Fig. 5).
Un the vertical substratum the fellewing was abserved:
