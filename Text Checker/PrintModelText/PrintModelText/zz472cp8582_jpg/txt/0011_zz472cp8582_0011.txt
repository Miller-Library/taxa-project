te secrete the substande as the recavery time between induced
secretienz was increased. Further zupport for this conclusion come
from remults abtained in the secend experiment using ferty new snail
that were left in the tanks for a week before meing preveked inte the
mecretion prccess. All forty of these snails, after one week with ne
predators to attack them, were able to secrete a large amount
(eqdivalent to the "4" en the scale) af the hypcbranchial substance,
But, the eighty original snails that were induced to secrete the
slise en the day they were collected anly had a 87.57 pesitive
mecretion rate, and not all of them secreted the "Ã " equivalent.
This indicates that mame af these snails had probably been recently
attacked in the field and forced te use the exudate to escape and no
had time te regenerate it before they were captured. This has the
motential to allow predater-prey studies in free ranging pepulations
by messuring the numbers of attacks that were nat successtul.
Furthermere, when comparing the averages calculated for both
the amounts and the bicassay reactions (Figs. 10,11), it appeare
that four days is not encugh time to generate the strang ""
reading for the amount of secretion released, but it is a leng
encugh time to generate a strengly volatile secretion, therefere:
1) The recovery period necessary te preduce the largest
amaunt of the exudate lies somewhere between the lengest
tested pericd, 4 days, and the ebserved peried at whicn
100 of the Ce canaliculatum population secreted the
suvalatttheaday.
2) Since the "4" on the Exenspadia reaction scale did net
garrempond to the "4" an the scale for ameunt af yellew
chserved, it appears that the active reagent af the
cempeund dass nat lie in the yellew part of the substance.
This latter observation is supported by biechemical tests run on
