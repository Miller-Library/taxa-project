hours in culture and as late as S days, after which time cultures were
discarded.
Heuronal viability was tested vis low-light video
microscopy. When loaded with fura-2-Aft followed by ionomycin and
manganese, a substantial increase in cellular calcium influx occurred.
This change confirmed previous membrane impermeability to calcium,
and suggested cell viability. In addition, cells from other cultures were
similerlg loaded with fluo-3-AM followed by KCl. After KCl addition, an
immediate cellular calcium influx occurred, which indicated that the
cells had been depolarized and were viable.
Control cultures were studied for longevity (see Fig. 1).
After S hours in culture, S5 of plated cells were undamaged, according
to trupan blue tests. This viability percentage decreased somewhat until
Dau 5, at which time only 50E of the cells were still alive.
In a series of experiments, cultures of various ages were
exposed to Imti glutamate for S minutes, stained with trypan blue the
following dau (see Fig. 1), and examined under phase contrest. Although
no immediate visible change was apparent during the glutarate
exposure, latent effects of neuronal degeneration resulting in death were
seen within 24 hours. After this lapse of time, neurons in some plates
were replaced by debris (See Fig. ?) and stained with O.43 trupan blue.
addition, onlu a fraction of the original culture remained plated i dag
after exposure, a considerable number of cells had become detached
during the process of degeneration. Cultures not exposed to glutamate
remained completelu plated. Desth rates of cells which had remained
plated after Imtl glutamate exposure were as high as 6 over control
