substantial. As the habitats became rougher and less
protected, their respective densities seemed to decrease.
An interesting and statistically significant correlation
was discovered between the number of black surfperch under
the railroad tracks and the height of the tide. (Ses figure
5) Os the tide rises, the number of Ex jackseni beneath the
tracks decreases.
I usually found these fish concentrated in tight groups
of about 15 under each of the algae covered railread ties and
maintaining a pacing behavior back and forth to either side
of the ties. Aleng with the relatively calm water in this
habitat, the tracks seemed to afford these perch a protected
area and a large, open, horizontal plane of water to inhabit.
They were all adults (20 to 30 cm in length): I once saw a
large black chase a smaller black from beneath a railread
tie. I recognized four pregnant females and one juvenile.
witnessed black surfperch feeding both by picking and
winnewing. On seven sightings threugheut the study I
cbserved Ex jacksoni moving in odd manners: quivering and
flipping to one side seemingly scratching their dersal fins.
Interestingly, I zau higher numbers of black surfperch
than usual in the ares protected by seal rocks during my two
nicht snorkels. They seemed less active nocturnally than any
other species.
