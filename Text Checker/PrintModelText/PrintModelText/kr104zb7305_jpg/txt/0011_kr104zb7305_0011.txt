correlation is not statistically significant in the channel,
the data suggests a trend that I believe weuld be supported
by mere cbservations.
DISCUSSTON
The great variation in densities of different species in
various habitats displays the existence of niche diversity
ameng the five ce-occurring Embictocidae species in the
st√ºdy. The protected, nearshore zone contains a dynamic
population of surfperch, the patterns and distributions of
which are not always obvious from casual ebservation.
The black surfperch showed a clear abundance in the
prttected area beneath the railroad tracks during leu tide.
They seem'te be less successful in rough, exposed areas.
Eventhough I have been SCUBO diving and srorkeling in all
areas of immediate prosimity to the railread tracks, Iam
baffled by the question of these black surfperch's babitat
during high tide. I think that more distributien studies of
the greater surrounding area would be revealing.
Eoth the striped and the pile surfperch appeared to be
mest successful in the most exposed habitats altheugh these
tue species, more than any other, were relatively evenly
distributed threughout the study area. The strong
correlation of these fish seems interesting not only because
that trend has not been reported in ather areas or at Foint
Cabrilld before, but alse because these twe species have
