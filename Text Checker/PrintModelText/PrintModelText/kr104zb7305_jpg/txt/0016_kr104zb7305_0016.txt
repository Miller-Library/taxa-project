tuo species' segregation by depth in Santa Earbara,
California. There, Ex lateralis dominates the shallow, more
desirable reef, pushing Ex jscksoni inte deeper water. From
recent studies at Hepkins by Tom (19788), the black and
striped surfperch off of Feint Cabrillo shared an identical
feeding niche and did not differ significantly in
distribution. Ny observations revealed that the two species
wære significantly differently distributed aver a lateral
ares of similar depths. Combining the gut analysis from Tom
(1788) and my results, theseitwe fish are eating similarly in
different places: factors other than food preference are
determining their habitat cheice.
The differing results that Tom (1988) and I found ceuld
indicate the differences in cur methods of ebservation and
perspectives on cur respective transects. Her observational
esperiment was done by observing a quadrat of one continuous
habitat. This comparison demonstrates clearly that the
cheice of tranzect and method of analyzing it dees affect the
results of a transect experiment. The niche diversity thåt I
observed, specifically among the black and striped surfperch,
displays that different potential transects which, from
initial observations, leck very similar, in fact have very
different surfperch populations.
One inevitable concern of observaticnal studies is the
cleudinesz that surrounds the effect af the cbserver on the
behavier of the subjects. I can only hope that I scared all
species away in equal preportions so that my ratios have
