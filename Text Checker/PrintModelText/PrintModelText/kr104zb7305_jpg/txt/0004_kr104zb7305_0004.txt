distribution and behavier of the Embictocidae in a 3800
square meter section of the protected nearshore zone at Faint
Cabrille, California (see figure 1). I used snorkeling and
cccasicnally SCUBe diving gear and recerded my counts and
observations en underwater paper. Observations were
conducted at different times during the day and tidal cycie.
The study area was divided into five separate habitats: the
time spent in each was recorded and remained fairly constant
for each respective area. A str√ºctured pattern was followed
on each sporkel survey in order to aveid as much repetitive
counting oftindividuals as possible.
Habitat A (370 square meters), the area under and arcund
the railroad tracks, is very well-protected from surge and
breaking waves by Seal Rocks. Ehyllespadig covers the
shallew intertidal area of the tracks; algae grows all over
the submerged tracks and ties which are approximately one
foct above the sandy bottom. The area slcpes doun to a depth
of 10-15 feet, where the tracks end and a small grove of
Macrecystis begins. I usually spent 15 minutes here.
Habitat B (1600 square meters), the area protected by
Seal Rocks, is marked on its scuthern boundary by a sand
channel. The bottom is characterized by medium-sized and
large rocks, thick Ehyllespadix, and sandy patches. Other
than the sandy, shallow ares near the shore, the approximate
depth of this habitat ranges from 4 to 8 feet. Surge is
greater in this area than at the railroad tracks, but rarely
strong. This is a popular swimming area for harber seals.
My cbservatien time here was abeut 30 minutes.
