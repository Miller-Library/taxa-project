These fish have a gestation period of appeximately five to
six menths (Burgess and Axelrod 1984), ending in the
springtime. Live-bearing is am evolutionary adaptation to
reduce early direct mertalitys thousands less eggs are
fertilized yearly.
Behavioral and dietary studies have been conducted in on
tuo congeneric species, Ex iscksomi and Er latemalis. Hixon
(1980) cbserved competitive interactions between the two
species in Santa Barbara and found the striped surfperch to
be the deminant competitor aver the shallow algae-covered
resf, leaving the black surfperch te forage over deeper turf.
Similar studies at Hopkins Marine Station hy Tom (1788)
reported that the black and striped surfperch there share
their available prey rescurces and de not differ
significantly in distribution.
Observations made by Nichels (1979) of the surfperch in
a 20 square meter transect in the same area as my study
reported sharpnese and shiner surfperch, bath found in
schools, to be the most abundant Embictocids, follewed by
pile, black striped, and calice surfperch. A personal
Communication by C. Baxter reported large schools of shiner
surfperch from 1974 te 1988 and an abundance of dvarf
surfperch from 1985 to 1987.
