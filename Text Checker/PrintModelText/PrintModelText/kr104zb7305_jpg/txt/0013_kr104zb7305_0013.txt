and appearance to the reef surfperch, from 1974 to 1988.
This spring, I cbserved very few individuals of those two
species: entreme annual variaticn is gecurring among the
populations of smaller surfperch." Future cbservations of the
present scheels of reef surfperch weuld be interesting. Uhat
are the seasonal and yearly patt√¶rns of their population
structures to where de they relccates schools of which, if
any, species will replace them?, Do emmigration and
immigration play a large rele in structuring these
populations er are they dependent en the dynamics from
reproductive recruitment? The unique life cycle of the
Embietocids, which includes the viviparcus production of
advanced juveniles, makes their population dynamics an
interesting comparisop to that of ether resident species.
Observations or habitat manipulations could be conducted in
order to determine what factors dictate these yearly
variations of high magnitudes.
The results concerning the reef and the black surfperch
display that the tidal height is a significant variable
affecting at least two of the surfperch populations in my
study area. I found ne conclusive distributional effect gf
the time of the day, but because of my low numbers of night-
time cbservations, still believe that the ammeunt of light
cculd have and effect on surfperch distribution.

one decade by comparing the average densities that I cbserved
with these recorded in 1979 in anether study of a transect in
