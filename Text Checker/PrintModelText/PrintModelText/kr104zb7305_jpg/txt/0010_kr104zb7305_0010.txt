The rainbew surfperch were the lesst dense of the five
primary Embictocids in the study area. They wereschserved in
greatest density in the exposed habitat between Bird and Seal
Recks in scheels of 10 to 20 on the sandy botton. The same
behavior was observed in the area arcund the railroad tracks
and an the scuth edge of the Seal Rocks habitat gn the border
of the sand channel. I often observed rainhow surfperch
feeding by picking at the algal turf af the sandy ccean
floor. H. Carvi were Farely seen cutside of their schools as
individuals. I chserved twe noticably pregnant rainbow
surfperch.
Reef Surfperch (Micrometrus aureral
The most dense Embictocid in the entire study area was
seen primarily in the area protected by Seal Focks. A
statistically significant cerrelation was found between the
number of reef surfperch in this habitat and the height of
the tide: the lower the tide, the greater the number of fish
inhabiting this area. (See figure 6) During leu tides, the
reef surfperch were ebserved in large schools of 50 to 100 in
the shallow, sandy, nearshore section. Several times I
noticed the presence of these schools while standing on the
recks nest to the water at lew tide.
The other fairly abundant appearance the resf surfperch
made was in the channel beyend Bird Rocks. Here, they
appeared in the more protected section of the channel. In
this habitat as well in frent of Seal Rocks they seemed to be
more abundant at lew tides. (See figure 7) Altheugh the
