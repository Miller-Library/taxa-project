cbserved in this channel for appreximately 10 mirutes.
FESULTS
Througheut the entire study, I sad a total of il species
of Embictocids (see table 1), five of which were abundant
encugh for me to hypothesize about their distribution. These
five species (the black, striped, pile, rainbow, and reef
surfperches) and their average densities in the entire study
area are presented in figure 2.
The average densities of each species in each habitat
are shoup in figure 3. The large variations display that the
five diverse habitats contsin very different distributions of
surfperch, indicating considerable niche diversity ameng the
Emhictocids of this region. The graph of percent abundance
(figure 4) shows the habitat(s) in which each species seems
most successful er prefers to live.
The results are presented separately for each of the
majer species. Tables 2 through 7 list the complete data
from each habitat.
Elack Surfperch (Embictega jacksenil
Altheuch the black surfperch were the fourth mest dense
in the entire study area, they had by far the greatest
density of any fish in any habitat when found beneath the
railread tracks. Likewise, the protected area under the
tracks was the anly habitat in which their density was
