the same regich (Nichols 1979). Whereas the density af black
surfperch seems to have remained constant, the densities of
striped and pile surfperch have increased substantially while
Femaining generally consistent with each ether. Neither the
rainbow ner the schools of reef surfperch were ebserved in
the transect in 1979: it seems that large schools of shiner
and sharpnose surfperch were'seen instead. This data
cerrelates with the Bazter cbservations of schools of shiner
perch in the study ares over the last fifteen years, while
this year it seems that few individuals remain. Nichels alse
reperted schecls ef sharpnose surfperch and some appeararice
of calice surfperch, neither of which species seem to exist
aff of Feint Cabrillo this spring. It is interesting that
the shiner and sharpnose perch bear size, shape, and some
dietary similarities to the reef surfperch and
Correspendingly, the rainbow and calico perch share size and
pattern characteristics.
Nichals' data showed ansther interesting decadal
variation that at the same time of year in 1979, larger
densities of black and pile juveniles were observed than
striped juveniles. (Nichols 1979) This comparisch is
contradictery to my observations of large numbers of striped
juvemiles in 1789. (See figure 9)
Because the number of pregnant striped decreased and the
number of ycung-of-the-year striped increased as my study
progressed, I believe that I witnessed a critical peint: the
and of E. lateralis' five- to six-menth gestation period.
