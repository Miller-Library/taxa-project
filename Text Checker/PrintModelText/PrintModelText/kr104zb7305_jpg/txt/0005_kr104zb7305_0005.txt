Habitat C (530 square meters) is the relatively
unprotected area between Seal and Bird Rocks. Surge and
stell increase fairly dramatically as one moves inte this
habitat; waves are often breaking just scuth of Eird Rocks.
The depth here is 10 to 15 feet; it centains the sparse edges
of the kelp forest and some Ehyllospadig covered rocks. I
spent 10 minutes cbserving this'area.
Habitat D4(730 square meters), the ares protected by
Eird Recks, is marked en its southern beundary by Fete's
Rock. It is a shallew area of approximately 5 feet in depth
with parts being too shallow te snerkel at low tide. The
bottom of the scuthern side is light-colored and sandy, while
Ehyllespadix grous thickly in the northern secticn. Although
this habitat is protected from breaking waves, the water
currents can be very strang as the water moves through the
channel in ene direction to the scuth. Observation time here
ranged from, 10 to 15 minutes.
Habitat E (570 square meters) is the channel beyend Eird
Rocks that leads into a more exposed section af Monterey Bay.
Ehyllespadik'is heavy, but as the area slopes down to its
maximum depth of 15 feet, the surfgrass divides to line the
edges of the sandy channel. The channel cpens up onte some
scattered Macrecystis plants which mark the end of my study
area. This is the most viclent water of my study: water
rushes between the rocks at high speeds, the surge and swell
are very large, and waves are often bresking at the mouth af
the channel. There is a small, more shallow and protected
