significantly different diets. While the striped surfperch
feed from the algal turf, the pile surfperch appear to be
selective visual feeders on larger smails and hermit crabs.
(Nichols 1979) This separation apparently permits them to
expleit their respective reseurces witheut competition.
The rainbeu surfperch, though nat as abundant as the
ether four species, were consistently found in small schools
on sandy bettoms in depths of ten or more feet. Altheugh
they did not occur in the exposed channeli past Bird Recks
which dees have a sandy bottom, they appeared to be
successful in the rough but less-expesed area between Bird
and Seal Rocks. Ferhaps the rainbow surfperch can live
successfully in schools en any sandy bettom se long as the
surge er rough water is under some critical point.
The mest dynamic population af Embictecids was the reef
surfperch: depending en the heicht of the tide, their
numbers ranged from zero to 250. Figure 6 suggests that
there could exist some critical tidal level such as 1.5 feet,
under which the large schools of reef are always in the Seal
Rocks habitat. As with the black perch, I have only
speculative insight inte the high-tide habitat of the
Higrometrus aurgras they could be broadly spread threugh the
complex rocky shallow water habitat.
According te the personal observations of Chuck Baxter,
large schools of dwarf surfperch (Micremetrus minimus,
congener of the reef surfperch) inhabited the nearshore zore
off of Feint Cabrille from 1985 to 1987. He also reported
similar large scheols of shiner surfperch, related in size
