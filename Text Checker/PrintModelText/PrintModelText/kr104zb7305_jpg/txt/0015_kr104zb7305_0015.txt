e
beginnings and ends of the different species' gestation
perieds made my theery difficult to cenfirm. Nichels
observations as they relate to my data suggest that gestation
does not cccur at precisely reqular intervals each year, but
rather may be dependent en weather, temperature, or ather
seasonal variables. Consecutive annual spring cbservations
could yield a clearer picture of varisbility of gestation
periods.
Intuitively, it seems that in order to benefit frem
their evelutional adaptaticn of viviparity and to pretect
their small vearly batch of fertilized eggs, the pregnant
female surfperch weuld be required te change their behavior
during the conclusien of their gestatich peried. The ventral
sides of the pregnant surfperch I chserved were ebvicusly
distended and lighter in coler than the rest of their bady:
at this hloated period they were inevitably less hydrodynamie
than usdal. Therefore, it seems appropriate that the
pregnant striped surfperch oecured most densely in the most
protected habitat in my study: the railread tracks. The
comparitively high numbers of injured pregnant Ex lateralis
suggests either that these pregnant perch gannot swim as well
as their lithe ccunterparts, that the bleated fish are mare
attractive to their predaters, er both of these hypotheses,
One suprising result was the different distributions of
the twe congeners, Ex iacksoni and Ex lateralis, in
different habitats with approkimately the same depth.
According to Hixen (1980), competition is the cause of these
