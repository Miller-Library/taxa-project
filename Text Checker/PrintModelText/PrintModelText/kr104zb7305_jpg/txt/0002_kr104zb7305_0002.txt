AESTRACT
Ie examine what factors influence surfperch distribution
and behavier, I made cbservaticns of a protected nearshore
area off Foint Cabrillo, California at different times of the
day and tidal cycle. Within the study area, there was
substantial niche diversity in the members of the family
The
Embictecidae among different habitats of similar depths.
black surfperch were found in the most protected area of the
study and in highest densities at lew tide. The striped and
pile surfperch were equal in abundance in all habitats. The
rainbou surfperch were seen in small schools on sandy
bottoms. The reef surfperch were the mest abundant species
of Embictecid: they inhabited a shallow nearshore region and
concentrated in large schools at the entrances to channels
during lew tides.
Niche diversification seems to be a relevant way of
viewing dynamic fish distributicns and an important factor to
be considered in choosing methods for conducting pepulation
studies.
INTRODUCTIOM
Embictocidae (surfperch) is a viviparcus fish family
found chly in the Morth Facific and fairly abundantly in
Monterey Eay. A diverse populatien occurs in the protected
nearshore area of Feint Cabrille. As with other viviparcus
animals, the young are nurtured internally by their mather.
