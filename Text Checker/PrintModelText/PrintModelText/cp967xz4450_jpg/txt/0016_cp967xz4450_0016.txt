C
the shell, scar-level rings would merge and travel rediallg
toward the margin (figure 150). In this manner when the shell
ultimately fractured the top would "pop-off" and the margin
rim left behind would split in two.
E. OBSERVATIONS OF FRACTURE PATTERNS AT THE MUSCLE SCAR
1. Visual-- In longitudinal scar loading most shells
would develop a small crack at the very front of the shell at
the level of the scar under sub-breaking loads (seen
perticulerly in C limatule during fatigue-loading). Once the
force applied reached the critical level, the entire top would
break off cleanly at the scar. In mang cases the fracture at the
front of the shell anterior to the actual myostracum was
jagged and irreguler, while the fracture at the scar itself was
smooth. Margin-loaded shells tend to break first at the scar
level. In mang instances the entire top would fracture cleanlg
before the margin shattered.
2. SEM-- Closer inspections of scer fracture surfaces
under the scanning electron microscope revealed a smooth
