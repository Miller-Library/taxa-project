B. FORCE VS. THICKNESS WITHIN EACH SPECIES
Comparisons emong force/thickness means within esch
species at the four grasping orientations showed no significant
differences, with the sole exception of C. limatule shells
which break more easilg at the margins than the scars
(longitudinal margin vs. longitudinal scar, p..00 1, latera
margin vs. leteral scar, p..05). Therefore the grephs of force
vs. thickness for each species (figure 10) show the overall
trend for all four grasping orientations treated as one set of
dete. Again, onlg A. mitre produced no overall significent
trend in force vs. thickness.
Figure 11 shows the results of the forces required to
fracture the rims of C pelte shells (missing the top of the
shell above the scar) compared to intact shells. Shells missing
the apical portion (above the scar) did not fracture at a
significently lower force than intect shells, and thus onlg the
overall trend (with force vs. thickness for all shells grouped
together) is plotted. This graph shows again that more force is
