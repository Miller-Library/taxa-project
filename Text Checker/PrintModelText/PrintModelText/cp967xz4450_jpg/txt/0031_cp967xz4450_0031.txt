the width of the scar.
6) The width of C limatule shells at the scar was significantig
less than the other species, suggesting that more crebs are
able to crush this species' shells at the scer since more crebs
can actuallg grasp these shells et the scar width.
7) Above 603 of the predicted breaking force fatigue loading
fractured shells of C pelte and C limatule in under 200 cycles.
Above 70-752 less than 50 cycles were necessarg, suggesting
that crabs can crush limpet shells without ever exerting 1002
of the force required to break an unfatigued shell. Also,
smaller crabs incapable of exerting 1003 breaking force loads
for large shells can still crush the limpet shell
8) Fatigue cracks originate at the front of the shell and usuallg
travel along the muscle scer, eventually severing the top of the
shell.
9) SEN observations revealed crossed-lamellar sheets at the
muscle scar oriented such that cracks mag travel between the
sheetstenergetically favorable direction) and eventually cause
