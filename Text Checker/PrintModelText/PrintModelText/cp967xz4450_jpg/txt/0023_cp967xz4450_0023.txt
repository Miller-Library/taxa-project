instead obtein a better grasp (apply the force with the teeth of
the claw) at the scar width. Furthermore, by gripping the sheil
at the width of the scar this 20mm long cheliped would most
likely exert a greater total force (similar to a person squeezing
an object between the fingers and palm compared to just
between two fingers). A possible conclusion is that crabs in
general can expand their food resources by crushing limpets
along the muscle scar, especially along the width.
The comparison of scar widths in figure 13 shows that
for shells similar in length (18-21mm) from the four species
measured Colliselle limatule has the smallest average width
at the scar. This finding suggests that given equal numbers of
shells from these species a crab would be able to grasp and
crush more C limatule shells than ang other type. This result
might help explain why more C limatule shells are found on
the beach having been frectured et the scar (Chapin, 1966).
Another reason that C limatule (the "file limpet") shells might
be easier to grasp than, for instence, 4 mitre shells is that
