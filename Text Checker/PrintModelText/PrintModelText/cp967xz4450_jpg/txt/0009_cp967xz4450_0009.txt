4) Force applied along the length of the muscle scar, here
termed Lateral Scar.
The same device was used to test if shells missing the
portion of the shell above the scar (such that onig the rim is
left intact) would be easier to break than completelg intact
shells. For this test used Colliselle pelte shells and applied
the forces at the front and lateral margin.
B. FATIGUE-LOADING EXPERIMENTS
Colliselle limatule and Colliselle pelte shells were
loaded repeatedly for five seconds at a time for up to a
maximum of 200 cycles. The loads applied were some frection
of the predicted breaking force ranging from around 10-902.
Values for the predicted breaking force were determined from
the results of part A for the two limpet species in question.
The values were taken from the linear regression lines for
force vs. thickness (figure 10). The tests were conducted using
the same crushing devices previouslg described, with a known
mass attached to the spring scale. During each fatigue
