1) Shells of Colliselle pelte, Colliselle limatule, Colliselle
digitelis, and Acmees mitre all break cleanly along the muscle
scer when crushed in a crab-like manner.
2) Colliselle pelte, C. limatule, and C. digitelis shells require
more force to break as scar lager thickness increased. A. mitre
shells show no clear trend in force vs. thickness.
3) Aside from C. digitalis being 1.3 times easier to bresk along
the length of the scar then C limatule, there were no other
significant differences in force/thickness among the species
tested.
4) Generally no significant differences appeared for (force to
break)/(scar thickness) within each species among the four
grasping orientations. The one exception was C limatule
shells which are 1.8 times easier to fracture at the
longitudinal margin vs. longitudinal scar.
5) The width of the shell at the scar proved to be significantig
less then the other three dimensions for eoch species,
suggesting that crabs could grasp moretand larger) shells at
29
