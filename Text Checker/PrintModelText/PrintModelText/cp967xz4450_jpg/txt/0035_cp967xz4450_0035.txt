show external surface of shell from the top. A. "Front scar“ refers to a
force epplied longitudinally et the scar. B. Front margin" refers to a
force epplied longitudinallg et the mergin. C. "Lateral scer“ refers to a
force epplied laterallg et the scar. D. "Leteral mergin" refers to a force
applied laterallg et the margin.

element model. A. Greting(perallel bleck lines) used to project lines onto
the shells. B. Diegrem of projector set-up. The lines are projected(in e
dark room) onto the shell and the contour pattern photographed. C. Top

side of the shell ere pleced next to each other. The coordinate axes pass
through the apex(at the origin). E. Final limpet model(A mitre shown)
obteined from topographic map. The dark circles are nodal(XYz) points.
