breaking force (obteined from lineer regression velues of force
vs. thickness for C limatule and C pelte respectivelg)
appeared fairly accurate, as those shells loaded in excess of
200 cycles at low percentage loads and then tested for
breaking strength bg fracturing the sheil generallg broke near
predicted force values. The fatigue plots also illustrate that at
eround 70-752 (and ebove) of the predicted bresking force,
fracture resulted(almost alwags) after fewer than 50 cycles.
Light(dissecting) microscope observations of fatigued shells
demonstrated the development end extension of fatigue
crecking. Figure 154 shows the typical pattern of 1-2 stress
cracks (white lines on the shell) beginning at the front of the
shell; over time these cracks spread around the inner surface,
generallg traveling along the muscle scar lager (figures 158 &am;
16). Cracks at the margin and scer (seen on the shell's
underside) almost always spread out eround the shell(in
elliptical rings), while closer to the apex the cracks moyed
radiallu (figure 150). Often, especiallg at the front and back of
