creck surface resulting from cleavage of the crossed-lameller
structure between the primarg lemellae (along the grain). As
seen in figure 17, the parallel crossed-lamellar sheets ran
along the shell at the level of the muscle scar with each sheet
parallel normal to the outer surface of the shell (figure 170).
Figure 17B illustrates the smooth fracture surface along the
side of the scar, showing that the crack passed between
lamellae.
F. FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS STRESS DIAGRAMS
The stress diegrems for C oigitalis in figure 19 show
the relative compressive (colored plates) and tensile (white
plates with numbers) stresses resulting from forces applied at
each grasping orientation. The shells with forces applied along
the length and width of the scar shov tensile stresses
concentrated where the force was applied, with low
compressive stresses elsewhere. In contrast, the shells with
forces epplied at the margin length and width show high tensile
stresses ot the point of application as well os high
