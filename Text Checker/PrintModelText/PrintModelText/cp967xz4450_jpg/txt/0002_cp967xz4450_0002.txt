ABSTRACT
This study examined and compared the forces required to
fracture limpet shells. Shells of recently-killed Calliselle
pelte, Colliselle limatule, Colliselle digitslis, and Acmses
mitre were frectured in an apparatus mimicking the crushing
behavior of crabs. In addition, shells of C limatule and C pelte
were tested for fatigue frecture by repeatedlg loading the
shells. All species save A mitre showed incressed force
needed for fracture as shell thickness increased. No
significant differences existed in force es a function of shell
thickness among the species nor within each species for forces
applied at the length and width of the scar and margin.
However, shell size at the width of the scar was significantig
smaller than at the other orientations for each species,
suggesting that crabs could attack more shells at the scar
width than at other places. Also, shells of C limstule had
significantly smaller widths at the scar then the other species,
suggesting that perhaps more C. limatule shells are found
