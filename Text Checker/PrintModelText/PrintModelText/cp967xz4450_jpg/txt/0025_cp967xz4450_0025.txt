60-653 of the breaking force to fracture the shell within 200
cycles. This result is similar to values given by Boulding
(1986) and Curreg (1984) for fatigue in bivalves. Significantig,
if a crab can ezert at least 70-752 of the predicted bresking
force, the number of cycles required for fracture decreases
tupically to 50 or fewer, es shown in figure 14. As Boulding
(1986) demonstrates, mang crebs fatigue shells over periods of
hours or even dags. In this manner, a Fechygrapaus crassiges
or other crab could eventually fracture a shell (using a fev
force pulses at a time) without remaining exposed to predators
or other adverse conditions for extended periods of time.
Although a crab will most likely not apply the same level of
force at the same exact location each time, the total number of
cycles required will still be well below 200.
The observations of fatigue crack development show that
most cracks originate at the front of the shell just below the
muscle scer end subsequentig travel around the shell along the
scor. Regions of high tensile stress were marked by white
