compressive stresses at the level of the scar (see color
scheme, figure 18). Also of note is that forces applied at the
lateral scar and margin produced greater tensile and
compressive stresses at the front of the shell and at the scar
(compared to forces applied longitudinally along the scar and
margin).
also compared stresses between a high profile (.
mitra) end low profile (C. limatule) limpet shell of equel
length and found that at each grasping orientation C limstule
reached greater stress concentrations than A. mitra For
instance, application of 802 of the predicted breaking force to
C. limstule along the length of the scar resulted in a stress
equal to 7-103 of gielding strength at the scar and margin,
while a comparable load for A. mitre (808 predicted bresking
force) produced a stress equal to onig 1-33 of gielding strength
(figure 20).
