in most cases the lemellee change direction after a short
distencetfigure 22), forcing the creck front to fork. Thus in
tupical crossed-lamellar structure a crack is halted unless the
force applied increases. However, in practically all the muscle
scar fracture surfaces l observed, the lamellae remained
oriented such that the crack could travel completely around the
horseshoe-sheped scar without crossing lemellee. Even where
the fracture surfece was slightlg more ragged, a short distance
later the crack surface was once again smooth, having cut
across the grain briefly to where it could continue between the
sheets. Therefore, it appears that the mechanism for
pop-topping" at the muscle scar involves the crossed-lamellar
sheets and not the actual prismatic myostracum. This outcome
might be anticipated since the myostracum forms only the
inner surface of the shell. Although prisms ere stronger than
crossed-lemellar sheets (Curreg, 1988), the high tensile stress
at the inner surfece of the shell is probablg sufficient to
frecture the prisms. However, it is not until the crack reaches
