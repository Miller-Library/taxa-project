fractured et the muscle scar because these smaller scer-width
shells are within the grasping range of more crabs. Fatigue
fracture proved significant (causing fracture below 200 cycles)
at force loads above 602 of the predicted breaking force. Above
70-752 of predicted strengths, fracture required less than 50
cycles, indicating that within short time spans crabs could
fracture shells without ever exerting a maximum force.
Scanning electron microscope observations revealed that the
crossed-lamellar layers along the horseshoe-shaped scar lager
form almost continuous sheets that allow cracks to frecture
the upper portion of the shell cleenly at the muscle scar.

previous study on intertidal limpets (Chapin, 1966)
focused on the predatorg of the shore creb, Fechygrapsus
crassiges. Several limpets, particularly Calliselle limstule,
left in an aquarium with a crab were found after several dags
to have been crushed near the muscle scar. This form of attack
