The horseshoe-shaped muscle scer (figure 28) on the
inner surfece of limpet shells results from the attachment of
the foot adductor muscles. Although Chapin (1966) found C
limatule shells to break more easilg along the length than
width of the scar, was interested to discover if some feature
of the actual shell structure along the horeshoe-shaped scar
accounted for the fracture charecteristics. In particuler,
HacClintock (1967) describes the myostracal (muscle scar
lauer of the shell as differing from the typical
crossed-lamellar structure of limpet shells (figure 34). At the
scar the muscle attechment interferes with the usuel
shell-laging process of the mantle. The resulting structure is
usuallg prismatic, and Curreg (1974) describes this structure
as stronger than crossed-lamellar (tensile strength Â»60FN7me
for prisms). The prisms of the myostracum form the inner
surface of the shell (figure 3B). Figure 4 shows the effects of
a crushing force applied by a creb cheliped, with the result
being tension along the inner surace and compression along the
