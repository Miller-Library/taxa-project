high compressive stress et the scer, resulting in fracture et
forces equal to or less than those required for frecture directlg
at the scar. Further evidence showing the scar lager to be a
structurallg weak region came in the Calliselle pelte rim
fracture tests (figure 11), where shells missing the top
portion(above the scar lager) fractured at the same range of
forces as intect shells fractured at the margin.
Finally, the finite element analgsis graphs also
demonstrate that equal length C limatula end 4. mitre shells
develop very different stress concentrations. Comperison of
figure 20 A and B (and C and D) show that at each grasping
orientation the stresses in C limatule are much greater than
those for 4 mitre. Again, the most likely explanation involves
the thinner scar lager in Calliselle limatule at equal shell
lengths. With less shell material to contain the stress, stress
levels cleerly rise in C limatule shells and cause frecture
much more quicklg.
