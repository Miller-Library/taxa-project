the ribs on the back of C limatule shells offer a surface for
crab cheliped teeth to grip, while 4. mitre shells are often
smooth and slipperg. Finallg, although the force/thickness
values were similar for each species, at a given shell length
limatule shells have the smallest average thickness at the
scar, implying that not only could more crabs fit their chelae
around C limatule shells, but also a smaller force is necesserg
to fracture the shells.
FATIGUE FRACTURE AT THE SCAR
Fatigue fracture of limpet shells meg be importent in
two manners. First, by repeatedlg loading a shell to a force
below that required to immediately fracture the shell a crab
avoids using maximum exertion, thus conserving energy in case
of a sudden emergency (such as appearance of a predator).
Also, through fatigue-loading, a small crab incapable of
exerting sufficient force to fracture the shell in one squeeze
can eventuallg crush a lerge limpet. The results of the fatigue
experiments show, however, that a crab must exert at least
