C
exception being that Colliselle digitelis shells were ebout 13
times easier to fracture at the length of the scar than
Colliselle limatule shells. This outcome indicates that the
force required to fracture shells of most limpet species
depends more on the material properties of the calcium
carbonate shell than on the particular shell shepe. Thus in
general tall, high-spired Acmaee mitre and low, flat Calliselle
limetule shells of similar muscle scar thicknesses will
fracture at similar crushing forces.
Within esch species, shells of similar scar thicknesses
fractured along both the length and width of the muscle scar
and margin did not break at significentlg different force
ranges. Taking into account that the thickness of the shell
margin might influence the force at which margin-loaded sheil
broke by comparing force to relative thickness(scar
thickness/margin thickness) similerlg produced no significant
differences. Again the only exceptions appeared in Calliselle
limstule, where the shell broke more easilg along the length of
